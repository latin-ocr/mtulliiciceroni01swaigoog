neae findam in Sabinis, qni est ad quartem et nicesinnnt lapident nia
Salariae Roma? Quidni? inquit, nbi aestate diem immitia dimitere
soleam enni eo Reate en arbe. It was the rond by which sait was conveyed
from the saltpits near Ostia into the interior; hence called Salnn'n.

The same name was given to the gnte which was afterwards known as
Collina.

nescio quid: a phrase of contempt, heightened here by the omission of Α
the verb, ‘and then—something or other about the fight of the Locrians ³.
(cf. 11. 6.) There is the same contemptuous reference to the opponent's
arguments in Din1148tabes et respersionem piqntentoenrn et rostrsnn
aa et alio permulta. (tf. 193 inscio qaid dissentiret. The preceding ct
enim easily suggests the understood narrabas.

homines homine natos: ‘the very patronymic proves their morial
origin' ; but according to the common tradition it was only Castor who was

son of Tyndareus, Pollux being the offspring of Jupiter; and the name
Dioscuri, familiarly used of both, might have supplied an equally valid
argument for their divinity. In Homer however (oe. x1299) both are
sons of Tyndareus. For the construction cf. 1103 igne nasci, also 1 42
mortales en imntortali procreatos n

recens ab illorum aetate: elsewhere Cic. makes Homer a contempo-
’ rary of Lycurgus, i. e. about 300 years later than the date usually assigned
to the Trojan war (Tnsc. v 7, R. P. 11 18); other writers, ag. Crates, sup·
posed him to have belonged to the generation succeeding the fall of Troy
(Grote’s Har. c. m), Por the constr. cf. Varro nn. 11 8 §2 pnllnni
a partu reenttern, Liv. xxl 16 tostan recentem ab excidio opulentissimae
nrbes, [San. Onna nd Marc, 1 8 vnlnere rneritie a sangnine. J. E. B. Μ,].

sepultos: the reference is to Il. 111 243, where the poet commenta on
Helen’s wonder at the absence of her brothers; ὣς φάτο, τοὺς δ’ ἤδη κάτεχεν
φυσίζοος αἶα ἒν Λακεδαίμονι αὖθι φιἊῃ ἐν πατρίδι γαίῃ.

cantheriis: ‘goldings'‚ from the Gr. κανθήλιος, ‘beast of burthen';
rand l being interchanged, as in grando: χάλαζα, hirando: χελιδών,
οεηηοοεὲλμις. The cantherius was strictly opposed to the war-horse
(Varro lt. n. 117 ξ 15), and the word is here used moekingly, as catenes
for Pegasus by Juvenal 111 18, and forts caballinus for Hippocrene by
Persius 11. [Add to exn in Lern Varro Men. fr. 5 Biicheler, Tertull.

nullis calonibus: ‘without lackeys'. Abl. of Attendant Circum-
stances, Roby § 1240 foll. See Paul Diac. Festus p. 62 M. Calones

princeps: sc. senatus I do not know whether this is stated elsewhere.
Cato was then (nc. 168) in his esth year and in the height of his activity.
In the following year he pleaded the cause of the Rhodians in a speech
which he inserted in his θνίρὶοοε. Much in the seme way Cic. ridiculas
