DESIGN AND EXEOUTION Oh THE DIALOGUE. XV

argument and of singularly little interest in itself. The lst is the
historical sketch of previous philosophy from the Epicurean point of
view, which is of much the same value, as if a historiam of modern
religious thought were to take his account of German philosophy

own translation of the Aratea ,· the 3rd and the most incompre-
hensible of the three is the mythologioal section, in which he attempta
to show that there were many separate deities confused under the
Ι same name. In speaking of these as insertione, I do not mean that
the lst and 3rd are exclusively due to Oioero and had nothing
corresponding to them in the Greek original, but that in all three
cases a very subordinate point has been allowed to swell out beyond
all proportion, and that in order to make room ior them, matters
of real interest and importance have been either omitted or curtailed
to such an extent as to become themselves unintelligible Thus, how
willingly should we have exchanged the first insertion, either for an
intelligent and impartial review of the growth of religious philosophy,
or for a fuller account of the life of the ‘intermundian' gods 3
how willingly have dispensed with the Aratea in order to obtain
more information asto the Stoic doctrine of the dealings of Provi-
dence with the individual, so oruelly out down in the concluding
paragraphs of the Second Book, above all how gladly should we
have escaped from the futility oi the mythologioal section, if we
might thereby have secured space for a reply from Balbus, or even
for a fuller statement of the Academia argument on such a question
as the consistency of moral virtue with the Divine nature!

Taking the book however as it· stands with its faulty proportione,

what are we to say of the manner in which each separate part is donet ·

The introduction, which gives the ¹key-note to the whole treatise,is
of special importance as expressing Cicero’s own convictione in regard
to the need of a true religious belief. ‘A mere pretence of religion ⁹,
he says (in reference to the Epicuream, hut the same thing applies to
an Academia like Ootta) ‘is inconsistent with any true piety‚ and
without piety faith and justice cannot exist and all societyis sub-
verted.' Piety is necessarily bound up with the belief in the pro
videntia] government of the world 3 there can he no such thing as
worship, unless we believe that the gods are interested in men and

are able and willing to benefit them. But we must be able to give '

a reason for our faith, and not embraoe an opinion without investi-
gation, merely on the authority of others While the Stoice have ,
