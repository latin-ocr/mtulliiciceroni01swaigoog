graph. It is strange that, after announcing his intention of postponing
the arguments of Cleanthes, Chrysippus and Zeno to the 3rd head of
his discussion, Cicero in ἓξ 20, 21 merely commences his reply to the
‘and head (ΙΙ 45, 46) and then falls back on the arguments of Zeno
and Chrysippus, dealing with the same point Schwencke proposes
an ingenious explanation of Cicero’s change of plan. He thinks that
the title of Clitomachus’ treatise was περὶ προνοίας; and that, when
Cicero, feeling himself unable to carry out his original intention of
answering each argument of Posidonius in its proper order, spoke of
deferring certain arguments to the section on Providencc, his real
meaning was to set asida altogether the Posidonian order aud follow
that of Clitomachus instead Further he supposes Clitomachus to
have commenced his treatise with a preliminary argument on the
divine existence, just as Posidonius commences his own defence of
the belief in Providencc (ΙΙ 75) by showing that it follows necessarily
from our conception of Cod. Hence it might well include the
Carneadean argument for the mortality of all animal nature (111 29-
34) as well as the criticism of the abovementioned arguments of
Zeno and Chrysippus. There ean be little doubt that Cicero has
borrowed the criticism of these in §g 21-26 from his Greek original ;
the argument in ἓ 23 is, as we have seen, cited by Sextus as from
Alexinus. It may be asked why the argument of the Xenophontio
Socrates is discussed out of chronological order in ἐξ 27, 28, though
it was not mentioned along with the others in ἓ 18. But so it is also
in 11 18. In both it comes in as an appendage to the argument from
Chrysippus: it is probable therefore that it was cited by Chrysippus
and criticized as a part of his argument by Clitomachus. Schwencke
finds a confirmation of his surmise as to the title of Clitomachus'
work in 111 65, where Cicero, attha commeneement of the section on
Providentia] Covernment, uses the words dequibus armachan dis·
serendam pato. So far Ι am disposed to agree with him, but I see no
reason for doubting the Carneadean origin of ἕξ 39-65 because of

occasional allusione to the former book It is not pretended that any
of the topics treated of are unsuited to Carneades, and however

careless Cicero may have been, he was surely capable of remembering
whether the same topic had been touched on in the previous book,
and, if so, of adding to the verisimilitudo of the dialogus hy making

a reference to it. Nor can I agree with Schwencke when he says that
it would be hazardous to assume the puro Carneadean origin of any
portion whichis not supported by a parallel in Sextus. Sextus being
