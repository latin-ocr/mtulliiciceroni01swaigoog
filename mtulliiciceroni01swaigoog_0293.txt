N. D. and agrees with cic. in each case as to the number oi synony-
mous deitiea, in fact only departs from him in making Hyperiona
the mother of Sol, aud in his description oi the 3rd and 4th Minerva,
making the 3rd the inventress oi arms and daughter of Saturn
(instead oi Jupiter), and the 4th the Coryphasia oi the Messenians
instead oi Ocria the inventress oi chariota In the account oi Sol
the divergence may be explained by simple carelessness, in that oi
Minerva he has iollowed the Protrepticoa of Clemens, which seems to
have been one of the chiei sources ol' his book. It must be obser-ved
however that in another passage (111 37 cited in the note on Musae
554) he refers to Mnaseas, Ephorus, Myrtilus and Crates as au-
thorities Iastly Ampelius, whose treatise is an epitome oi the
poorest type, follows on the whole the order of Gicero, but has the
most extraordinnry divergences, introducing such names as Granicus,
Joab, Orio, Joppe, which can hardly be explained away by the
corrupt state oi the text: and there are besides signs that he follows
a Greek original Thus the names oroneo Cronia are plainly Greek,

and the phrase Jove daberis filias seems to be a mistranslation of
Διός τοῦ stota. He also adds further details, ag. that Hercules
founded the Olympian gemes (ci. Diodorus quoted on Idaeis Diyitis
§42 n), that he taught Atlas, that the mother of the 5th Minerva
was Titanis3 and even brings in a deity, omitted by Gicero, vin Mars.
Also in common with the other parallel writers he is silentes to
Pan being the child of Penelope and Mercury (ἕ 56), and as to the
names oi the Muses and Dioscuri (55 53, 54).

From the above consideratione it would seem that the four
parallel writers must have had access to some other authority besides
Cicero: was this authority Clitomachus? Ι think we may say this
is impossible in the case oi all but Clemens, and not very probablc
even in his case. If however we compare certain other authors who
are to some extent in agreement with Cicero, where he departs from
the ordinary tradition, Ι think we shall find indicatione oi an earlier
common source from which the tradition was derived both by
Clitomachus and by the later epitomists. Among these authors are
Servius, the Virgilian commentator, and Lactantius Placidus, the
scholiast on Statius, in regard to three out of Gicero's five Mercuries.
The latter names a certain Carvilius as his authority. 'Athenaeus
(quoted on ἓ 42 dotatae) names Eudoxus as authority ior the state·
ment that Hercules was son of Jupiter and Asteria. The contest
between Apollo and J upiter (ξ 57) is said by Fulgentius to have been
