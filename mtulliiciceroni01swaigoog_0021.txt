impression produced by the Natura Deorum, I think it cannot be
denied that the latter is iar less impressive than either of the former.

by an excellent education, with the widest tastes and sympathies, and

a mind open, as that of few Romans has been, to all impressione =

of beauty and sublimity. But, considered as a philosopher, he has
the mislortune to be at the same time a lawyer, an orator and a man
of the world : in hisphilosophioal treatises we are too often consciens
of the author holding a brief, appealing to the populace, writing
against tium and amidst countless distractione, far removed from the

wholehearted concentretion of a Plato or a Lucretius We must η

not wonder therefore if Oioero's wide scheme contracte itsell to the
paraphrase or adaptation of two or three contemporary writings
and the exposition and criticism of the Epicurean and Stolo theologies.

Contenting ourselvss with this lower ai1u we ask again, how it
has been accomplishedl Is the exposition clear, accurate and metho

to answer these questions I will quote the estimato given of Oicero's

probably side with the latter view. While allowing that we

have in this treatise a great deal of excellent sense admirably Ι

expressed, and that it is hardly possible to exaggerate its histo
rioal importance as contributing to our knowledge of the religione
philosophy of the ancients, yet, regarding it as a whole, it is

impossible to cellit a work ol art, it is impossible to say that the l
