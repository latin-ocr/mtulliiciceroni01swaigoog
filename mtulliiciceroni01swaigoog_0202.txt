was a theological treatise professing to be written by Hercules, just as
the Poemander professed to be written by Hermes Clement mentions
that the priests of Isis were required to know by heart the Hermetie
, books, 42 in number, and that these were regularly carried through the
temple in proeession (Strom. vr 4). We have a specimen ofthe sacred books of
the Egyptians in the ‘Ritual of the Dead' lately deciphered and translated.
Plato alludes to them (rim. 23), where he represents a priest as addressing

Solon in the words πάντα γεγραμμένα ἐκ παλαιοῦ τῇδ’ ε’στὶν έν τοῖς ίεροῖς
...τῆς δὲ ἐνθάδε διακοσμήσεως παρ’ ἡμῖν ἒν τοῖς ἱεροῖς γράμμασιν ὀκτακισχιλίων
ἐτῶν ἀριθμὸς γέγραπται. We must also distinguish our Pteyyiae lr‘tterae
from the Φρύγιοι Λόγοι of Diagoras, mentioned by Tatian c. 44, in which
the mysteries of Cybele were ridiculed.
