doubt that A represents the archetype, that in CB and V cl hare
been mistaken 111 d and that in V the letters were wrongly grouped.
This seems to show that A is independcnt 11 V.

ἓ 11. Sagram A, all others are allured by the easier sacram.

ἓ 22. inanimarum AB²V⁸‚ inanimatarum B¹V¹E, animarum 0.
There can bc little doubt that the archetype (a) is 'represented by A
and that the commones form is written by error in B¹V¹.

548. duces A¹, right as shown by the following resportdebia,
ΒὉΕᾸῙΙ have by carelessness 111111, PA¹V² dicis, B' dices.

ἓ 71. commenurabantur A, commorabatur others.

589. quidam A (so Baiter), quidam 1111111 the other uss, ¹

except that B' has quidem. It seems more likely that A should
have overlooked 1111111 than that it should have been inserted
by the rest

True 1111 preserved by B 11111.

§A parurn, pareant AV1E, parea OV'. Probably 1111111111,
which being followed by accepi would suggest parva or parvam .· 11, ¹
11 Madvig is right in reading cepi, accepi may have arisen from ἢ

parua cepi in a, in which case B’s reading would be an emendation.
ἓ 8. quodenset perspicuum BV', where AV¹ have q. 1111, and ’
ΟΕ q. 11 p. probably by merc carelessness. ¹
§lh eos 11 cantheriis: here V has tuq, P tuque, Au 111111,
Ε quc tu. Iam inclined 1ο think that the q. 11 V (and probably of

α) was intended to be the first letter 11 cantheriis, spelt with qu for c,
like quattu 111 Cotta, quoinquinari 111 coinquinari, qrwtaerere 111

cohaerere, quorum canium for Coruncanium. We have a similar l

· instance 111 word just begun in ἕ 82 l. Pictorum legens noticed

above.
513. rationes reqeeiro BV'. Baiter with the other 1111 omits
requiro and it was no doubt a natural word to supply, but A's

' reading of the following word, recuntur 111 the secuntur 11 BV, seems

1ο have arisen from requiro sequuntur, tho eye 11 the scribe passing
from the 111 to the und qu. 11 11 we must suppose an intermediate
link between a and AV ou the one side, as between a and B on the
other side, the former link having recuntur, changed by V¹ into
secuntur, the latter preserving the reading 11 α.

518. omniaque quae a te BV',oncnia quae a te APV¹ (d crased '

after 1 111 AV), onnia quaeque a te O, omnia qiu a te. Herc APV
