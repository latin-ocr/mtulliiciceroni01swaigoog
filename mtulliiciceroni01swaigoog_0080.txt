latter is the more recent and much the fuller of the two, but neither
has contributed anything of his own 11 the elucidaticn of the book.
Reinhold Klotz did a· good deal 11 imprcve the text in his edition
1869, and hia Adoctotioocc Oriticoc od Μ. Tullii Ciceronis 115111 dc

the excellent emendation o porois caim for apparuisse in 1 80. But
no scholar has done so much as Madvig in his Opuacolc and his
edition 11 the Dc Finibus to improve both the text and the interpre-
tation 11 Oicero. We may perhaps be of opinion that only a small
proportiones his conjectures are likely to find a place in the final
text, but the arguments by which they are supported are always
full 11 instruction. The best existing texts are those of Baiter 1864
and 0. F. W. Maller 1878, on which more is said in the Introduction
11 my first volume.

Besides Olivet's French translation already noticed, may be men-
tioned the German translations by Meyer (with useful notes) ed 2,
1832, 1)] Schrtder 1841, byR. Ktihner 1863, with analysis and notes,
which are perhaps less original than might have been expected from
so distinguished an editor and grammarian, but which do not seem
to me 11 deserve the contempt with which dic ococste Ucbcrsctzurcp

J. H. Kirchmann (Leipzig 1875) is 1 very ignorant and unacholarly
periormance. Two English translations may be named, as fairly idiom-
atic , both are anonymous, but the latter (London 17 41) is understood
to be hy Thomas Francklin‚ 11111111Τ11111]0111131,(11111)111131.
It is what the Germana call 1 ‘Tendens-schrift' by a follower 11
Shaftesbury (see the notes on pp. 4, 87, 263). ΙΤ111 older translation
appeared in 1683. It is written from the ordinary point 11 view
and contains copious explanatory notes of an elementary kind.
