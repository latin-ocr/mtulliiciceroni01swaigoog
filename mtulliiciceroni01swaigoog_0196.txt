patellam-ime ficetum Verres abstulit magno eam 966616 evitata. We find
Cic. pleadiug iu vain that the people of Tenedos might be allowed to retain
their own laws (6111. 11 11 62). Alabanda is spoken of Fam. xm 56,
where we have the double form Alabandis (Ἀλαβανδεῖς Wea) as here, aud
Alabandenses, as below ξ 50. Alabandenses is also found in Orat. 11 95
and Alabandeus in Brut. ᾗ 325; see Lachmann ou Lucr. p. 281,

Leucotheam: luo is a goddess of the sea, known by the epithet Leu-
cothea, which was also used of the N ereids. She gave to Ulysses the veil
which supported him aster his shipwreck until he reached Phaeacia (Od. v
333-461), and was believed generally to help those who were iu danger at
sea According to the mythologists she was daughter of Cadmus and
Harmonia, and wife of Athamas: after plottiug the death of her step
children, Phryxus and Helle, iu a fit of madness she th'rew herself and her
son Melicertes into the sea The words of Xenophanes iu reference to her
worship are recorded by Aristotle (11161, 11 23 §27) Ξενοφάνης ’Eaedem
ἐρωτῶσιν εἷ θύωσι τῇ Λευκοθέᾳ καὶ θρηνῶσιν ἢ μή, συνεβούλευεν εἷ μὲν θεὸν
ὑπολαμβάνουσι μὴ θρηνεῖν, εἰ δ’ ἄνθρωπον μὴ θύειν. ln reality in this case,
as in so many others, a deity has been degreded into a mortal. She was
especially worshipped at Tenedos, where she was regarded as sister of
Tenues The Romans identified her, probably on account of some simi-
larity iu her ceremonial rites, with their Materte, the goddess of dawn, also
worshipped by matrons as goddess of birth; aud hence the latter also
cameto be regarded as a mariue deity; of. Taso. 1 28, Ov. Met. 1v 410 foll,
Faat. v1 475-563, where we have an Italian continuatiou of the Greek
myth. See on this and the following names Preller Gr. Myra, Welcker
Gr. Gettaielrre, as well as the Articles in Diot. of Myra.

Palaemonem: Melicertes, another form of the Phenician Hercules
(Melkarth) was identified with the sea-god Pal. who was worshipped with
infant sacrifices at Tenedos. The Isthmian games are said to have been
originally instituted in his honour (Paus. 144 § 11). The Romans con-
sidered him to be the same as their Pater Portunus, the god of harbonrs,
on whom see 11 66. For the order 6166 Ρ61. filiam, cf. below ξ 48 layas
Absyrto fratri.

Herculem—Romulum: see uu. on 1162. These, as Italian deities
whether by birth or adoption, are contrasted with the preceding foreign
deities.

ascripticios: the adjective is not found elsewhere in the classieal
period, but O. not unfrequently uses the verb, as in Aret. 6 aneti ae ia
eam 6166161666 velud, ib. 7 ai qai foederatis 6166611666 6661ρί1 esau.

Oh. xvr § 40. omitto illa-praeclara: ‘I say nothmg of those other
dogmas: verily they are admirable '. Of course ironical, as iu Acad. 11 66
jam illa praeclare, quanto artificio esset 66666 nostros eaedemque. . febriente
catara: see 6. 66 palraamir 1 20. Instead of caim we might perhaps ¹have
expected quamquam, ι11669111166666 indeed fine specimens'; but euim
refers 66116 omitto, but to illa. If we supply any liuk of thought, it
