worthy of consideration It rested on a large induction of facts and
supplied a very noble theory of morals and religion¹. Still the
Stoios had laid themselves open to the criticism of the Academy, partly
by their over-positiveness in doubtful matters, partly by their anxiety
to finde justification for the popular belief in regerd to divination
and the multiplicity of gods In his 3rd book (liceto states at
length the Academic objections to the Stcic view, but concludes by
avowing his own preference for the letter'.

If we compare this treatise with one which had appeared about
ten years before, es a posthumous work, edited by Cicero himself

· after the death of its author, I think we cannot doubt that the ,
later treatise was written with distinct reference to the earlier. 1

Quintus (1110) is thus explained by Munro p. 108, “There seems 1ο have

himself on this head, that Cicero may mean 1ο answer ‘yes, you are quite

right in saying that Lucretius has not only much of the native genius of
Ennius, but also much of that art which, to judge by most 01 the poeta of the

follow (sed, cum temris, sirum te putabo, ss‘ Sallustii Empedocleo legeris, bominem

on his return 10 Rome: Cicero says ‘if you accomplish your purpose 1 shall
