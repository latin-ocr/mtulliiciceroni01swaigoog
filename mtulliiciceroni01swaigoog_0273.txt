pyro (so Grote Pt ἰι cla 84, vol 11 p. 91), but the name mentioned in con-
nexion with the engine of Demetrius is not Epimachius, its actual con-
structor (as we learn from Vitr. x 22 ξ 4), but a certain Diocleides of

Abdera; hence it has been supposed that Dioclsides was a writer, admired ³

for his description of the Helepolis, or even (taking θαυμάζεται as middle,
so Schweig. in loc.!) that he was ono who expressed his admiration for it.

(ln Didot’s Scapt. Aisa. lfayn p. 133 it is quoted θαυμαζέτω.) 01 the ¹

same principle we should understand Timaeus here to be the historiam,
though it would seem from previous quotations that his description could

not have been so celebrated as that by Philistus. We may form some
idea of the magnificence of the pyre from the account given of another
pyra by Herodian lv 2 (quoted in Dict. of Ant. under apotheosis). We
come now to the word typanidis, various emendations of which will be
found in Not. crit, some turning on the discsse, others on the place of
burial. As we have seen that the pyre itself was so celebrated, it seems
not improbable that the name of the constructor may have been added.
Professor J ebb however prefers the reading of B (tyrannidis) and refers in
support of it to Isocr. Areia. 49, where it is said that D. was once shamed
out of a ssight from Syracuse by the words of one of his friends, reminding ζ
him dr καλὸν ἐντάφιον ἡ τυραννίς ‘the purple is a noble winding-sheet' ¹

[cf. the words of Theodora in the sedition an. 532, as cited by Gibbon y

ch. xl, ‘For my own part I adhere to the maxim of antiquity, that the
throne is a glorious sepulchre’. Swains'on], and ro τυραννῶν τὸν βίον
testeae (Canbr. Pidoi. Trans. 1 p. 21, where there is a wrong reference Ἴ
to J. of Phil. v 266). There is a remarkable resemblance between these
words and those quoted above from Philistus (a writer cited in the De
Divinatione, which was written just after the N. D. and taken probably
from the same authorities), but 1 do not think tyrannidis royarn is an
expression which Cic. could have used. If it meant anything it must
11111, as Lambinus observes, ‘the extinction of the tyranny', like berctam
reipublicae iu Piso 9. Ishould myself suggest that the original reading
may have been something aa follows, in sno lectulo mortuas, at tyrannidis
subido maynificam baberet endam, in Typanidisil) royano dietas at. If
Typanidrs is right (any name with the same termination would account
for the omission of the words following tyrannidis), it would probably be
after the form Alcibiades, Oanwades. According to Plutarch S. N. V. p.
559 the body of D. was afterwards taken up and cast beyond the bound-
aries by the Syracusana See on ths whole passage Fortsch Qu. Patr.
pp. 1-5 Naumburg 1837, 8111111111 Opnsc. 111 p. 353.
