fore the patron oi Athens: ifwe make Apollinis antecedent to quem
Arcades colunt, it would seem to identify him with Apollo thaor; but in

that case we should probably have had aas before quem.

specillum: see a full account of its use in Diet. of Act. av. cbinwpio,
Foes Oeooa. Hr'ppocr. and the illustration in Rich's 1110000100.Ι The
corresponding Greek verb is metaphorically used by Cic. Ata ΧΠ tl τοῦτο

obugawwezefirae,11aemedaumreqoeem a qao oblrpetrar [Bell. y
1118814, Sen Ep. 28 ξ 8. J. E. B. M.]: Celsus uses the word deligo in

fulmine percussus: ‘after being struck by lightning '. According to
the usual story he was slain by Zeus for raising the dead to life, see
Pindar Pyra. 111 1—105 cited by Clem. Al. Protr. ξ 30, and Dia. ⁰f Biop.

cyneam: this is usually understood of a district of Sparta3 whence
Callimachus (Draco 94) calls the Spartan hounds Κυνοσούριδες. See
Clam. Al. lc. Ἀσκληπιὸς κεῖται κεραυνωθεὶς ἕν τοῖς Κυνοσούριθος ὁρίοις.
Sch however notes that a Mount Cynosura is mentioned by Steph Bya.
p. 490, and suggests that there may have been a Cynosura in the vale of
Cynuria (Pausan. vm 27). This Cynuria was the parent state of Gortys,
where there was a tomb of Aesculapius, see below on Laerb flamine.
Possibly Cynosura is a mistake for the well-known Lycosura in Arcadia.
The most usual tradition makes Aesculapius buried at Epidaurus (Cyrill
0. 111. vi p. 200); but in a later passage of the same book (vm p.
288) 11 is said that none knew where he was buried

Arsippus: he is not mentioned in any independent authority: perhaps
there may be some confusion with Leucippus.

Arsinoe: according to the Messenians Aesculapius was the son of
Apollo and Arsinoe, daughter of Leucippus (Paus 111 12, 26, 1v 3.
Asclepiades, a disciple of Isocrates, is cited to the same effect by the
Schol. on Pindar in Heyne's n. on Apollod. 111 10. 3). Pausanias tells
a story of an Arcadian who presumed to question the Delphian god himself
on the subject, and was informed by the oracle that the real mother was
Coronis (ib. 11 26).

cian treated a single disorder, some undertaking to cure diseasesof the eye,
others diseases of the head, the taath, and so on. Gold stopping has been
found in some of the mummies. [Add to lexa Ph'n. Val. 1v 29, Cael
Aurei. Aac. 111 ξ 83. J. E. B. M.]
