Amsterdam 1724, 1011 adding considerably to tha collection 01
Daviea

In 1777 some slight improvements in the text were made in
Ernesti's edition, but the first edition of importando after Davies is
that 11 Heindorf 1817. Ηο was a sound scholar with an open eye
and independent judgment and, though he relied too much on inferior
codices, especially on his Codex Glopavioaua, and was too much
disposed to alter, yet, 11 Ι am not mistaken‚ au examination 01 my

critical notes will show that a larger number of accepted emendations >1

have proceeded from him thau irom almost any other single editor.
The edition 01 Μο001 and (lreuzer cum actia variorum Leipzig 1818,
and the smaller edition by Moser 1821, 010 1011 very disappointing.
Moser is laborious, 111 10 appears to me to have been the least
intelligent of the editors whom I have consulted, and Oreuzer had
no critical judgment. Their Apparatus Criticua, which professes 10
contain the collatioris 01 twenty new 100, 10 very confused and care·
less, as may be seen 11 comparing it with Baiter'scollations. The
notes 01 F. A. Wolf and Wyttenbach given at the end are mostly 01
01 elementary character. The great improvement in the text was
¹ commenced hy Orelli in his first edition 1826-1830, Allen (Alanus)
brought 011 01 edition with Latin notes, London 1836. These are
chiefly grammatical and critical, containing some good emendations
eg. nimis callide 1 70, meantia 11 126. The edition with German
notes 11 G. F. Sohiimann 1850 (411 aad last in 1876), isdeservedly
the most popular upto the present time. He is a sensible scholar,
who had shown his interest in the theology of the Ancients hy a
variety 01 000010 and commentarios, and he has made good use 01 110
notes 01 Davies. He was also the first 10 notice many 01 110
difficulties 01 110 text, but he complains that it was impossible 101
him 1ο give 1111 explanations within the limita allowed him, and it
would certainly be too much to say that he had succeeded in clearing
up all difficulties. Some 01 110 emendations have been generally
accepted, eg. afficiendam 101 efficiendum in 1 19, 01 which he was the
first to offer a rational explanation, 0010 was also 01 11 9 by ohanging

 

the reading 01 110 uss nulli oiri into 00110 cum viri. With his -

edition should be consulted his papers on the text contained in
110 Opuacaclo vol. 111 pp. att-384, 1v pp. 336-359 (dc Epicuri 1100
10110) and N. Jahrb. 101 1875 pp. 685-695. It is scarcely worth
while to mention the text of Ast 1829, and the elementary German
editions 11 80111 1834, and Freund in his Schuler-Bibfiorhek The
