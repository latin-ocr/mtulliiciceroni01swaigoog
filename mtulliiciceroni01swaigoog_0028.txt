01 the discussion deals with the Divine nature. This begins in 1 20
with a (11011001101010000 to the corresponding part 01 the argument
01 Balbus (11 45). In both the questionis 0001120 eorum 1101010011]
both refer to the stupcfying influence 0101101010. Ootta then proceeds
to challenge Balbus' assertion mundam 0010101000 ease 01 deum, and
the proof alleged 101 11 nihil mmrdo csse melias. ‘It no more follows
from this‚' he says, ‘that the world must be possessed 01 reason than

that the city 01 Rome is a reasoning creature, or that, if it is not,
it must be reckoned 01 less value than the ant which is possessed 01

reason! (01.0 45, 16.) But the same proof had been quoted as

itself, therefore the human reason is a product 01 the world and
resembles it.' ‘On'the same principle,' he says, ‘we might maintain
that the world could play the fluta' The next argument touched on
