aumrrousurr or uss xxxiii

5 20. a cosuetudiue euim, where euim is omitted hythe other
mss and given in contraction by V. In this case there can be little
doubt that V represents the archetype.

5 35. quem ipsum uua omues interpretantur auo modo, qui
quonium quid diceret intelieqi uelud, omittemus, where tho other uss
emitquiand even V seems uncertain. Baiter thinks nou omnes-modo
to be a gloss, which would naturally suggest a connecting qui before
quereiam: cn the other hand qui would easily be lost before
quouiuua

5 62. talis a philosophia pellatur error, where the final e cf
philosophia (which probaby commenced a new line in the archetype)
is written separately in V¹. From this the readings oi the other
uss would easily spring, via t. a pbilosophioppeilutur error A,
t. a philesophi appellatur e. 13¹0, t. philosophia appellatur e. B¹
(evidently altered to make sense), and sot. e philosophis appellatur
e. PE and V' (only that the last has apellatur). ·

5 70. quisquamne istuc aequt by corr. in V, where A has quis-
quam iuste (iuste being ‘in ras’ by a late hand), Ο quisquam istae,
BP quisquae istuc (quas cancelled in B), quid istud Ε. Ι am inclined
to think the archetype had quicqua stuc (for cxx. oi stuc in Cicero’s
uss see my n. and Lachmann's Lucr. p. 197), sc that here the
unaltered B and P are its best representatives.

5 7 3. aeque ut iude auferam (see n ia lec.) which, written
continuously in tho archetype, is nearly the same as V¹ seque tiude
auferam ,· the other readings are easily explicable from V, viz. aeque
unde aus. AOEP, and ue quidinde auf. B, which may be compared
with the superscription of quid over aeque in V'.

584. pecunia edixisse V, where B¹ has pecuniae dixisse, and ’
ΑΒὈΡ pecunia diuuse. Here it would seem that B must be either
taken directly frome ms in which the words were not separated, or
(es Ι think more probable), from a us wrongly copied from such an
archetype.

Το these some would add 5 66, where V has permiciem see iu loc.

Prae tect presumat by A abne.

¹ 567. posquam (so Baiter), others postquem.

568. querculum Thyestem, see nn. Phas quem chunipertum,
Oand by corr. B have quendum thyesteas, V quem deut hyeetem,
(corr. fr. hqeetim), E qaam duat thiestem. Here there can be no
