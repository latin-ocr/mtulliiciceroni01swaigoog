from the order 01 the heavenly bodies §§ 20-22 (N. D. 1195); others bya l

process 01 amplification rose from the finite iutelligence in man to the

conception of a divine intelligence in nature l 23 (N. D. 11 33-38) ; ’
others, among whom is also Democritus, from the terrible phenomena 01 t

00 the negative side it is maintained that these opposing views are

mutuelly destructive § 29 (N. D. 1 l, 5); but dealing with them separately ¹

we may ask, where did these early legislatore get their own idea 01 deity l

where did the ides 110011 00100 110101 and how could a mere imposture

utility is even more absurd. How can it be supposed that men would
make gods 01 what they ate and drankl There might be some reason
101 ascribing divinity to the power which holds together the earth and
makes it fruitful, but, sooner than call rivers divine, we should deity
philosophers, or even all 00110010 that are 01 use to man ἕξ 39-41 (Ν. D.

1160,11141). Democritus and Epicurus explain the easier by the more 1

difficult §§ 42, 43 (N. D. 1 121); they utterly fail to account 101 the
attributes 01 immortality and perfection ξ 44. Those who<fill up the
conception 01 divinity obtained from visione and the celestia] movemenls

by amplifying their experienoe 01 human blessedness‚ are really guilty 01 ’

Euhemerus, Diagoras, Prodicus, Critias, Theodorus, and, as some hold, by
Epicurus §§ 50-58 (N. D. 1 2, 63, 117-119, 111 89). The Sceptics on
the contrary hold that the opposing arguments balance each other § 59.

general voice 01 mankind, (b) the order 01 the universe, (c) the absurdities

As to (o) it is affirmed that religious belief and worship are common to all,

both Greeks and barbarians; that, if this belief were 10100, 11 must have 1
