DESIGN AND EXECUTION OF THE DIALOGUE. xvii

Tho Epicurean exposition, contained ing 43-56, 10 100 superior
10 1110 11101001οο1 0001100, but it suffers from curtailment, just where
full explanation was most needed. Unhappily Cicero had not time
10 think out a difficulty; so when he comes 10 000, hc either omits,
or satisfies himself with a rendering which is unintelligible 10 himself
as well as 10 every one else3 see especially what is said 01 1110 divino

must however be allowed that he is writing 100 Roman readers and
has 10 select 00 reject with the thought 01 what will be most in
accordance with their teste, just as the late Dr Whewell did in his
Platonis 1110110000 for English Reddere.

The Academic criticism which occupies the rest 01 1110 book
contains much that is interesting, but, here too, flippant assertion
not unfrequently takes the place 01 argument. Thus there 10 no
pretence 01 arguing the question between a pharam and 0 wewam
(j 65 1011.) ; the speaker dogmatically asserta 1110 preference for the
former, therefore the latter is wrong. The objections 10 anthropo-

morphiam are well stated in §j 76-102, but 010000 has either
misunderstood or has confused the argument cn the valuc 01 general
experience‚ as a criterion 01 100111, and the possibility 01 0 unique
experience (see nn. on j 87). In §5 103, 104 00110 000000000 his
