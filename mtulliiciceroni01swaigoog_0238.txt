shut it'. R.] Becker (Gallus tr. p. 282 1011.) referring to the same passage,
concludes from it that the rep. “allowed 01 the door being opened with less
trouble than by the sera, and that, as the name occurs only in the plural,
a crass beam 10 001 denoted by it, but two bolts meeting from opposite
sides (usually 01 0000, Ρ110. N. H. XV142 ξ 82)’'. Rich has an engraving
01 this (Cmnp. p. 549). Αο 11 10 plain that both explanatione are merely
guesseS, itis worth while 10 consider whether anything may be learnt

from an examination 01 the word itself. Repayalam might be nsed either
of ‘that which fixas back’, or 01 ‘that which unfixes'‚ ‘unfastens', such as

e a key. It is hardly likely that the same word wouldbeemployed in two

such opposite sensas: the passage in Festus is ambiguous, and in any case
we cannot be sure that Verrius may not have invented a meaning to suit
this particular line. Moreover the fact that the plural form alone is found
in this connexion, suits better with fastenings‚ such as Marquardt de-
scribes, than with 01100010 or key. Ithink 0100 that the idea 01 ‘fixing

Ἴ back' suits better with his ‘stays’ than with Beckers bolts Ι1 however

they were usually 01 wood, they could hardly be suspended from a ring
fixed in the door: it would seem more natural 10 suppose that they were
removable bars resting 00 sockets and placed obliquely between the iolding
deors and the posts. The word is also used of barriers in the racc-course
(Ovid. Met. 11 155, Lucan 1 295): in Amm Marc. 16. 12. 38 11 occurs in
the sing. with a metaphorical force, aaa equites aad praeter sapae aream-
speetaates praesidia vidisset Caesar, 0000110 eqao 00101 repaqrdam quoddam
cohibuit. As to the phrase rap. tradere, it would be most easily explained
if it were the custom for these bars to be handed over to the conqueror as·
a sign 01 surrender when a town was taken. It might then be used meta-
phorica'llyof any surrender. The word is used figuratively Verr. v 39 ameria
repagula juris, pedores, officiique perfivayere. Medea refers to the reprieve
she had extorted by her prayers and the use she means to make 01 11.
quibus-recludam: ‘by making use 01 which I shall unlock (let 10000)-

’ 011 my fury ². Medea speaks 00 11 her wrath were locked up in a chest by
. Oreon's decree that she was to leave at once. The reprieve 01 0 day

(Eur. Med. 355) enables her 10 open this chest and let 10000 her fury. 11
we translate trad. rep. ‘has put at my discretion the fastenings’, then
quibas ‘by which fastenings', is loosely need torquibus traditis‘through the
surrender of which I shall be able to unlock &e’ 1111Ι probably Creon, cf.

πικρόν was predicate to φυγάς 00 well as to κῆδος.
