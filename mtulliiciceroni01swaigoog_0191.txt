ρανο see 1 21 n. on spatio taurea ad fin. Balbus in common with all the
religious philosophare, had ascribed to the Deity the perfection of wisdom
and virtue (11 :ao—39), and had expressly argued that virtue and reason
must be identical in aod and man (11 79), though ou a greater scale in the
former. So Isocrates (XI ξ 43), expressing the ordinary opinion, ἐγὼ μὲν
οὐχ ὅπως τοὺς θεούς, ἀλλ’ οὐδὲ τοὺς ἐξ ἐκείνων γεγονότας οὐδεμιᾶς ἡγοῦμαι
κακίας μετασχεῖν, ἀλλ’ αὐτούς τε πάσας ἔχοντας τὰς ἀρετὰς φῦναι sall. But
philosophare differed with regard to the relation between divine and human
virtue. Aristotle was apparently the first to give prominenoe 'to this

question in his saying (Ett. vu 1), that we could no more ascribe virtue ·
