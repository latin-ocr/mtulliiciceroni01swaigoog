points omitted by Cotta arethe terms of divinatiou, the list of ancient
seers, the evil consequences of neglect of divination as shown in Roman
history, the recent increase of irreligion contrasted with the respect for
religion in ancient days. Again, comparing the argument against divina·
tion in Dia. 11 20, we have there first of all a proof that divination is im·
possible: ‘since everything happens by fate, and divination is, by defini·
tion, concerned only with the fortuitous, therefore it is concerned only
with the non-existent’, (see the same argument Fat. 17 foll. nibil fieri qnod
non necessefaerit, et qniaqnidfien' possit, id ant esse jam ant factas-arn esse,
na napis carinatas-i en neris insalsa ea posse qaae fittnra snnt qnam ea
qaae faeta sant): then follows in ξ 22, just as here, a proof that, even if
divination were possible, it would be useless; nay, knowledge itself, as
distinguished from the vague warnings of divination, would be useless,
atqne epo ne ntitem qnidam arbitror esse nobis fetararnnt res-wne wantiam.
It seems probable therefore that in the lost sentences Cicero had been
discussing the defeat at Thrasymene, just as in Div. 11 22 ant ι’μίιιιν non
sato interiit exercitas, ant, si sato, etiamsi obtemperasset auspiciis, iden
everterant fnisset ,· and we may suppose the argument to have run ‘what
good would Flaminius have done if he had observed all the omens, since
all things hoppen by fate and the future follows the past by an unchange-
‘able necessityl' (messario or some such phrase having been lost before
amanter, cf. Fat. 44 omniafiant cansis antecedentibus et incessantis).

ne utile quidem est seire: this is very impressively shown Dis. lc.
by the fate of the members of the socalled first Triumvirate. Dicaearchus
(Dio. 11 105), Favorinus (Gall. xrv l), and Diogenianus (Euseb. Pr. Er.
lv 3) wrote treatises to the same effect. Hence it follows that the gift of
divination would be a sign of malevolence, not of favour on the part of the
deity, Dia 11 54 toa ne hmines qnidam probifacinnt at amabis impendentes
