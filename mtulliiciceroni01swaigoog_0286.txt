ξ 93. non curet ningues homines: ‘you say, God does not trouble
himself about individuale’; but in 11 165 16 is distinctly asserted separatim
ab 6616666 rimatos deleta· compare the descending 666166 there with
the 'ascending ecer'tee here. Other Stoics however held that individual
good was not in itself the object 61 the deity but that it was necessarily
involved in his true object, the general good, 61 M. Ant. cited on 1164
and Seneca N. Q. 1146 6169666 666 adest Jeppiter, Zeller 111 lp. 163. The
saying in 11 167 meque dt curant, parea aeyleyuat (on which seem 85)

non mirum: the Academic comment, ‘I am not surprised at it; he
does 666 even carefor cities (such as Corinth and Carthege); and if he does
not care 161· them, why should he care for natione and races’ (such aa the
Greeks or Phoeniciansll

contemnet: logical future, ‘if it shall prove that he despises them'‚

idem dicitis, ldem: ‘how isit consistent in you to say that the
Gods do not attend to details, and yet to hold that they distribute dreems
to men l' cf. 11 166163, 166, Die. 1 39 foll. For persequi see above ξ 86.

haec tecum: Cic. would seem to heve forgotten thet Balbus himself
had touched on divination by dreems (11163); otherwise it would have
been unneoessary to state that it was generally credited by the Stoice
(oestro).
