in numero reponatur: cf. 1154.

speciem habeat: most edd. follow Em, in reading tader, which of
eourse would be quite right here, as the speaker has already expreseed his
agreement with the sentiment here uttered; but there seems no reason
why he may not repeat it simply aa the reason assigned by the mytholo
gists for their genealogy. I have therefore kept to the ns reading with
Mu. To understand the argument we must remember that admirabilem

Thaumante dieitur nte esee nata: the insertion of Iria ia naessary
to explain the gender of mata. It would be easily lost between (imitar and
ease. Hesiod(f⁷teoy. 265) makes Thaumas and Electra, daughter of Oceanus,
the parente not only of Irie but of other marvels of nature, whirlwinds,
Harpyes &a ; ef. Plato's interpretation of the myth (Theaet. 155) μάλα γὰρ
