ut apertis obscura assequamur: a similar argument ie used by Sextus
rx 167 to prove that εὐβουλία is notan attribute cf Deity: εἰδὲ εὐβουλίαν

ἔχει, καὶ βουλεύσειν εἷ δὲ βουλεύεται, ἔστι τι ἄδηλον αὐτῷ 2 to which he adds
‘and if. there is anything obscure to him, it is probably obscure to him
whether infinity may not contain some power which is capable of destroy-
ing him; but this would naturally give rise tc fear; and where there is
sear, there is possibility of a change for the worse, te. of death'.
nam justitia: in an absolutely solitary being this might be true; but
the argument is inapplicable tc the Stoice, who assumed a community both
of the gods amongst themselves and between gods and men; for wherever
there is a community, there are relative duties, and therefore occasion for
the exercise of justice in the strict sense of the term. It is still more
inapplicable when God is further regarded ae a Creator and Governor, for
the fact cf creation gives risa to very stringent duties οιι both sides, and
government consiste mainly in giving to all their dues For the'transitional
