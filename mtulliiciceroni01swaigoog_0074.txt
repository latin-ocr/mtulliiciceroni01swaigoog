It is evident from the above analysis that Cicero and Sextus
must have had the same book of Clitomachus before them, but that
both must have used much freedom in omitting and abbreviating, as
indeed Sextus avows §§l, 190. Even in the paragraphs distinctly
cited by both as taken from Carneadea, viz that on the necessary
mortality of all animal nature (N. D. 11129-34, Sext. ἐξ 137-147)
and the Carneadean sorites (N. D. ¹111 43-52‚ Sext. §3182-190),
there are great divergenees3 eg. as to the sorites respecting Jupiter
and his brothers, Oicero gives us his redactio od absurdum through
Orcus Sextus his through Poseidon, both no doubt included in the
original. A comparisou of the argument, in Oicero and Sextus
respectively, proving that virtue is incompatible with the divine
nature, shows what liberty the former allowed himself in cutting down
his original. The difficulty is to understand on what principle he
acted: sometimes, as here and at the end of the second book, he
omits what is interesting aud important, or gives it in such a con-
densed form as to make it barely intelligible, while at another time
hc wearies out the patience of the reader with the futility of the
mythologieal section. ’

It is worthy of note that the two arguments for which alone
Oicero cites the name Carneades are just the two for which he is also

named by Sextus At first sight this would suggest that the
remaining arguments in both must have been taken from some

other source than Clitomachus3 but it seems more probable that the
latter, and perhaps Carneades himself in his lecturas, brought
together sceptical arguments from all quartem, assigning each to its
original author, as for instance Alexinus is cited by Sextus S 1083
so that all I should infer from the above coincidenceis that Oar-
neades claimed these two arguments aa his own special property.
There is another treatise, besides that of Sextus which in certain
points strongly resembles this book of Cicero's, and that is his
own treatise De Divinatione written immediately after it. From my
notes 0115 14 it will be seen that the argument on the groundlessness
and uselessness of divination is almost exactly the same in both
treatises, hut the name of Carneades is prefixed to the corresponding
portion of the latter treatise (Dio. 11 9, cf. ib. 15-25). Clitomachus
is further cited by name Dio. 11 87, and Hartfelder detects his pen in
