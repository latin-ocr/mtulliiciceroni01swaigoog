that we cannot argue from man's view of right to God’s view 01 right, and
therefore that objections founded 01 the supposed immorality of Scripture
were unworthy of consideration. The logical consequences 01 his theory
were pointed out at the time in Maurice's book on fteeelate'on² and are now
sufficiently evident to 011 See H. Spencer First Prina'plee ch. 4

prudentiam: we find the same definition in Sext. Emp. 111 162, xr 170
(ol Στωικοὶ ἄντικρύς φασι τὴν φρόνησιν, ἐπιστήμην οὖσαν ἀγαθῶν καὶ κακῶν καὶ
οὐδετέρων, τέχνην ὑπάρχειν περὶ τὸν βίον), ib. ἐξ 184, 246, Diog. L. VI192.
The argument however is differently given in Sextus rx 161, ‘to know these
things he must have experienoed them, eg. he must have experienced pain,
and it has been shown that to be sensitiva to pain 1010 be liable to (100111’,
(abbreviated). On the cardinal virtues 000 Plato nep. 1v 427 foll.

cui mall—malorum: this would appear 10 follow from the maxim
common to all the philosophare, that (lod can neither do nor suffer evil,
see 011145 qaod beatam. The fallacy lies in the ambiguity attaching
10 the word ‘evil'. On the Stoic supposition, God being interested in
the world, which He administers, if any evil befcl it, Ηο would himself
feel it as evil, and therefore exercise the faculty which discriminates
between good and evil 3 but 11 reality all evil is overruled by Him for
good

ratione—intellegentia: ci. nn. on 11 147. The words are often joined

together to express the pure intellect, Die. 1 70 qaae antem parc animi i
10110011 atque intellegentiae ait particeps, earn tani manime algere 00ορ1101,
marn abrit a corpere ; Orat. 10 (Plato 01000) ait semper erae ac ratione et

intelnqencn 0001110011 ,· Off. 111 68; Tine. 2 (the eternal) intellegentia et .
ratione eanpretenclitnr; Lag. 127. Here however ratio must have its
special force of ratiocination, as appears from the clause which follows, cf.
110001. 11 26 argennenti 00001οι10, qaae eet Graece ἀπόδειξις, ita desinitur,
ratio qnae en retas paeeptir acl id, qaod nen percipiebatur, 00101001. What
then is the force 01 intellegentia? Probably it refers 10 the full rcalization
of the meaning 01 each term in the argument, as contrasted with the
recognition 01 the logical connexion of the propositione, 01. Aean. 1192
ambiguorum intellegentiam condadendiqae rationem, Irzeeat. 11 16010010-
yentia eet per 00000 animae ea perspicit 00000001. Or should we take
1111010 generally, as in the verse quoted 110111 Sir J ohn Davies by Whewell
Laetare on Rearon and Underetandiny ; ‘when she (the mind) rates things
and moves 11011 ground 10 ground, the name 01 Reason she obtains from
this: but when by reason she the truth hath found, and standeth firm, ’
