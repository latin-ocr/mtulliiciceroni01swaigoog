lese censetis: it was a part of the duty of the censors to let out
the various branchos of the revenue to the poliani for five years on
certain conditione (leges censoriae), which were published before ¹the
biddings commenced, cf. Verr. v53,111 12, Quint. Fr. 1 1 §la The
tribute imposed on foreign countries often took the form of a land tar,
on the other hand the expensos of the temple services were partly defrayed
from the sacred lande, cf. Harpocr. s.v. ἀπὸ μισθωμάτων p. 24, Xon Aaub.

slain, his father Poseidon persuaded Zeus to destroy Erechtheus with

ἶ athunderbolt‚ or, according to another account, himself slew him with

his trident. In consequence of this Er. and his daughters were honoured
as divinities. Oic. is fond of ‚quoting him as an example of patriotism,
