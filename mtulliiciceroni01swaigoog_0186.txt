soor< 111 cu. xm §32 93

meliore in deterius et a deteriore in arelius moritur, non eu deus.) A similar
argument was used by Panaetius (ap. Cic. Tuae. 179) to disprove the
immortality of the seul ; nibil esee quod doleat, quin id aegrum esee quoque
poerit ,· quod autern in morbum cadat, id etiam interiturum dolere autem
animos, erqo etiam interire. It was criticized by Augustino le. xxr 3
cujus rationes est dolorem faeere mortu argumetum, cum uitm potius sir
indicium? ‘The reason why we find pain kill here is because the con-
nexion between soul and body is not strong enough to sustain the shock;
but the soul will live on in spite of pain' The Platonists and Peripatetics
made the concupiscent part of the soul mortal; hence Virgil (Aen. vr 730)
binc (ie. er terrente artabae moribundisque membm’a) metuunt cupiuntque,
doleret gaudentque. The Stoice considered all emotion to be of the nature
of discsse, Tuec.1v23foll. ea perturbationibus ⁴uriumm morbi conficiuntur,
quae uocant itii νοσήματα...Ηοο loco reinrium operae eoruumitur a Stoicis,
meina a Chrysippo, dum morbis corporum comparatur morborum animi
similitudo. Trismegistus ap. Stob. Eeb. p. 192 denies that feeling must
necessarily be of both kinds.

nec potest jucunda accipere, non accipere contraria: ‘cannot re-
ceive the one without the other'. The initial negative applies to the
combination of the two things; of. below ξ 35 non imelleyo quo modo
calore extincto corporo interemit, non intereant umore &a For the Asyn-
deton see Index and n. on 1 20 euJ'ne principium.

accipiat interitum: cf. above §29 acupiendi aliquid n. Here it is
the translation of φθορᾶς ἔσται beaveris Sext. Emp. rx 145.

ξ33. praeterea: the particle is misleading here. What follows is
simply the preceding argument put into a negative form.

sin autem, quod animal est: Ι see no reason for the change of quod
into quid (Heind Mu). The argument proceeds regularly: ‘if there is
any thing of such a nature as not to feel pleasure or pain, it is not a living
creature; but if all that is living must feel them, aud that which feels
them cannot be eternal (and, as we said, all living creaturos feel); thenit
follows that no living creature is eternal'. Walker omits the clause et
omne animal remit before the conclusion, on the ground that it is otiose
and would in any case require ea. Logically hc is right, but a certain
degree of laxity is excusable in a dialogue, and logical exactness can hardly
be called a characteristic of Cicero's writings. For igitur in the epodosis
see above on ξ 30. For et with minor premiss cf 1. 110, Draeg. ξ 311. 14.

quod ea sentit: the us reading emetiar might be understood es giving
an indefinite force to the Relative; but es the definite statement prevails
throughout the passage, it seems more natural to suppose that the mood
was assimilated by an error of the copyist to the preceding amesae eet sentiat.
