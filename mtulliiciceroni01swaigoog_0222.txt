those as divinitiea it is rather absurd to make Cotta argue on the

tion of the impossibility of such a belief ; but this is only a proof that the
present book is no auswer to the preceding, but is merely copied from
carneades, who lived long before Posidonius, the authority followed in the
earlier book.

multo magis: thus Castor and Pollux were known in many places as
θεοὶ μεγάλοι, and identified with the Cabeiri of Samothrace. See below
on Alabandus ξ 50.

Aristaeus: cf. Verr. 1v 128 Aristaeus, qai invector otei erac άὶαίίαν, aaa
mam hibero patre eodem erat ia templo consecratas. He is invoked among
other deities at the beginning of the Georgica (1 14) and again introduced
as the instructor of mankind in bec-keeping (ib. 1v 283, 315 foll); but
Minerva is oleae inventrix (Geo. 1 18).

Theseus: ‘according to the common story he is scn of Aegeus, king of
Athens, and Aethra, but another legend made him son of Poseidon (Plut.
raes. 6, Apollod 111 15 ξ 7, Hyg. 37). In reality Aegeus is only an
appellative of Poseidon, and Aethra is a goddess of the air connected
with Athena ’‚ Soh.; cf. below ξ 76. There were templcs and a festival in
his honour at Athens. The difficulty of drawing any distinct line between
the human and the divine is brought out in Lucian's Ooacdium Deorum,
where we have the decree of Zeus requiring each deity to prove his claim,
See also Grote's Greece 1 p. 596 foll. ‘the mythical age was pecpled with a
mingled aggregate of Gods, heroes and men, so confounded together that
it was often impossible to distinguish to which class any individua] name
belonged’.

matres: ααααι deae supplied from patrea di.

jure civili: distinguished, as the law of a particular state, from the
jas victurae which, as common to all mankind, is frequently called jas
gentiam, cf. Off. 111 69 itaque majores aliud jue gentiam, alind jus civile
erae coluerunt. Quod cristianos idem conclamantium qood autem gea-
tiam, idem ciuile esee dedet.

matre libera liber est: cf. Gaius 1 82 [who gives this as a rule of the
jus gentiam, adopted in the jas civile of Rome, but modified in one or two
cases by special enactment. See also Ulp. [teg. v 8-10; Paul. Sena
1121s, R.] aa amala et libero jare gerulum servata ααεαίίαν et ea libera et

legal maxim, portas ventrem requitur. J. E. B. M.].

Achillem: this is the only place in which we are told that Ach. was
worshipped in the island Astypalaea, one of the Cyclades not far from
Oos. The Aeacids' were however worshipped in Cos, the old capital of
which was also Astypalaea 3 sc it is possible that the island may hare
been mistaken lor the city. ln the Dirc. ⁰f Geog. s. v. Astyp. it is sug-
