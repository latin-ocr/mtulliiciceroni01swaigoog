tion is that by Rinclr, Tritopclwes Triptolemus, for Triptolemus and
Eubuleus are sons oi Dysaules according to the Orphic tradition reported
by Pausan. 1 14 ξ 2, and (llem. Al. Protr. ξ 20. Ido not think however
that it is saie to make any change. It is evident that the tradition followed
by Cicero's authority departs very widely from the ordinary tradition ; and
in that strange intermingling oi mythologice which took place during the
Alexandrian epoch, it seems not impossible that the name Tritopatreus,
belonging to the early Attio mythology, may have been connected with the
equally ancient Anactes.

, Eubuleus: this is properly an epithet or name of Dionysus ‘good in
counsel', as we read in Plut. Oeae. p. 714, on the text ὅτι βουλεύεσθαι παρὰ
πότον οὐχ η’πτον ἦν Ἑλληνικὸν ἣ Περσικόν (he might have referred also to
the Germane and Norsemen); hence ol πάμπαν ἀρχαῖοι τὸν Διόνυσον αὐτὸν
εὐβουλῆ προσεῖπον. So, in the Orphic Hymns‚ Bacchus is addressed as
Εὗβουλεῦ πολύβουλε Διὸς καὶ Περσεφονείης (mx 6), and Εὖβουλεῦ μιτρηφόρε
θυρσιτινᾶκτα...πρωταγόν’ Ἠρικέπααε, θεῶν πατὲρ vide* καὶ υἱέ (1214). In H.
XXVIII 8 Persephone is styled μῆτερ ἐριβρεμέτου πολυμόρφου Εὗβουλῆοε,
while in H. xr. 8 the same is said of Demeter. In Η. nm Artemis is
called daughter of Eubuleus. Dionysus is also spoken of as son of Eubuleus
(XLI l) θεσμοφόρον καλέω ναρθηκοφόρον Διόνυσον, σπέρμα πολύμνηστον πο·
λυόνυμον Εὐβουλῆος. Again Eubuleus is identified with Pluto (addressed
in H. xvn 12 as ὦ πολύδεγμον Εὔβουλε), with Adonis (addressed iu
H. ΙΝ as Εὗβουλεῦ πολύμορφε, τροφεῦ πάντων ἅρίδηλε), with Phanes,f1'. 7
(ap. Macr. Sal. I 18) ὃν δὴ νῦν καλέουσι Φάνητά τε καὶ Διόνυσον Εὗβουληᾶ τ’
ἄνακτα καὶ Ἀνταύγην α’ρίδηλον.

tertii-Atrei 1111: we are nowhere told that Atreus had sons so
named. The famous soothsayer Melampus, who is said to have introduced
the worship of Dionysus into Graece, is entirely unconneeted with Atreus.
Then we read, in Nonnus xrv 16, of an Alcon, one of the (labeiri, who was
son of Hephaestus and Gabeiro and brother of Eurymedon . Tmolus is
a generally accepted emendation hy Dav. for Em'olaa of uss (connected
with Εὔιος l) because the former name occurs amongst the ancestors of
Atreus. Ihave thought it better to keep to the uss, as the extraordinary
eccentricity of (l’s mythology really leaves nothing on which to build
conjecture.

Πλουσίας νύμφης, Ἀρχὴν Μελέτην θελξινόην καὶ Ἀοιδήν. Mnaseas also, a
contemporary oi Callimachus, spoke of four Muses fildas Telluris el Oceli
(Arnob.11137, where we are further told that Ephorus made three Muses,
Myrtilus seven, Crates eight). Pausanias (rx 29) mentions that one
tradition recognised only three Muses named Μελέτη Μνήμη and Ἀοιδη.
