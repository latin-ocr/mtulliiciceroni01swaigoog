APPENDIX ΟΝ THE MYTHOLOGIOAL SEOTION. (ᾗῇ 41-60.)

Tan mythological eummary given by (iicero diverges in many
particulare from the ordinary tradition, but is in remarkable agree-
ment with what we find in four later writinga the Protrepticon oi
Clemens Alexandrinus (fl. 200111), the Liber Memorialia of Am-
pelius (a 250 an. 1), the Disputationes adoneae Gerana oi Arnobius
(fl. 300 A. n), the De Mercibus oi Laurentius Lydus (b. 490 aa).
Are we to suppose that these writers borrowed from Cicero or from
Cicero's authority Clitomachus, or was there some earlier common
sourcel There is no sign that Clemens was acquainted with the
works oi Cicero or even that he had any knowledge of Latin
literature; moreover he cites as his authorities, under the head of
Apollo, Aristotle and Didymus, and adds particulare which we do
not find in Cicero, e, g. that the 4111 Apollo was son oi Silenus,
that some writers made a 5111 and 6111 Apollo, that the 4111 Minerva
was called Ooryphasia and that the mother of the 5111 was Titanis.
On the other hand it is probable that the remaining three had some
knowledge of (licere. Lydus quotes from his Verrine orations and
had a fair acquaintance with Latin literature, especially with the
writings of Varr03 but he too cites other authorities, e. g. Terpander
for the lst Dionysus, ‘the poete’ ior the others, Melias, Grates,
Eratosthenes, Eumelus, under Zeus Again in many respecta he
diverges from Cicer03 thus, besides assigning a different parentage
lor the ard, 4111 aud 5111 Hercules, he names a 7111, son oi Zeus
and Maia. Moreover his references to mythology are scattercd up
and down his book, which is on the model of Ovid's Fasti, and
can hardly have been picked out from this section ot' Cicera.
Amobius probably copied from Oicero, as he often quotes from the
