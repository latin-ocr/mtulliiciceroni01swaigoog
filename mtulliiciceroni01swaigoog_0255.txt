comparison of these passages shows plainly that the Subjunetive may
have the force of debelm This use has been generally connected with

the Imperative force of the Subj, thus accounting for the employment
of ne for reon, but such an explanation has been challenged of late ³
by two distinguished Cambridge scholare on the ground that ‘a past
imperative is sn inconceivable thing ’. Ι presumo that those who used
the phrase ‘past imperative', simply meant that the subjunctive in this
use stands to tho Imperative, as the phrase ‘you should not have
done that' stands to the phrase ‘you should not do that'. Whether we 3
choose to speak of these as different tenses of the Imperative, is a verbal
question of no great importanoe: if we confine the Imperative to ,
commanda which are capable of fultlment, oi course we must select ¹
another name. The alternative explanation offered by Mr Reid (Sella
ᾗ 25 p. 96) ie as follows : “ socelled ‘ jussive subjunctives’ are merely parts .
of elliptic conditional propositione '' ; “the fact that ue occurs with some
ol these subjunctivae has led some scholare to regard them ae conveying
commanda or prohibitione put in past tenses, because the circumstances
to which they might have applied ars past...but ne is merely equivalent to γ
non, as ne often was in early Latin ¹². Mr Reid is commenting here on the l
words cc ei, judicer, ceteris patriciu me et voe peregrinor uideri oporteret, a
Torquato tenua loc ostiam aleretur...eet enim marnr'cspalssss, which Ι under· γ
stand to mean ‘whatever right other patriciana might have to dub us l
foreigners‚ Torquatus at least ought to have kept silence on thie defeet in '
our citizenship, being, as he is, himself connected with a mentepiam only’. ἶ
Mr Reid's note is “ editors explain sileretur ae equivalent to sileri debedat,
but the subjunctive in Latin has no such force ’'...“eileretar ie not the true ἐ
apodoeie to the protasis ei oporteret, but is rather the apodoeis to a
suppressed protasis such ae si caperet. So with Virgil’e famous words at tn
dietae, Albane, moneres ”. I confess Ι cannot quite make out what ie meant
by this, but we may compare another note by the same scholar on dead.
