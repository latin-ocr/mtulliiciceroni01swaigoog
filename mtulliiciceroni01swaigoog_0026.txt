DESIGN AND EXECUTION OF ΤΗΕ DIALOGUE. xlx

there is no external power to check the progressos the whole 3 there-
fore tho universe as a whole must attein perfectiora

The larger portion of the and book is occupied with the subject
of Providence. This is argued lst lrom our idea ol the Divino nature
as active and benevolam, and and from the skill manifaeed in
the universe, which attests the wisdom os the great Artist, just in
the same way as the orrery attests the wisdom oi Archimedes The
skill of the Creator is then shown in detail, istas regards the-earth
and the heavenly bodies, and as regards the adaptatione wisible in
vegetable and animal life, 3rd and above all in the case of man It
is further shown that the universe exista for the salre ol its rational

inhabitants, and that all things tend to the good ol man, that pro· ·

vidential care extends even to individual men, that virtue and wisdom
are divine gista, that the philosopher isdear to God and can never
experience what is really harmful.

So far I think we may be sure that Cicero would go along with
Balbus. It is no more than he has repeatedly said in his own

, person elsewhere, except as to the Scala of Existence, to which we

find resemblancea it is true, but no exact parallel in the passages
quoted in my notes. There are other parts ol his discourse which
are less in harmony with what we know of Cicero's opinions from
other treatisea Such are the identification of heat with intelligence,

the ascription of lise, thought and volition to the material universe ·

and the heavenly bodieS, tho sanction accorded bytho Stolos to the
popular mythology as representing either the varied activity of the
Suprema Being‚ the persenilioation oi abstract qualities, or the
divinity of the human sou13 to which we may add the belief in
divination ¹.

When we go on to inquire into the arrangement of the and book,
there is much to find fault with. The main divisions are by no means
clear. As is pointed out iu Vol. 11 p. xxii, much that is placed under

ι 1 Cicero, speaking in his own person, asserta the existence and the immateri-
ality of God, and ascribes to him the origin of all motion and the iatherhood oi
the human sonl Tuae. 1 66 (a quotation from his own omotario), animorum nulla
in terrie oripo inveniri potest...quicqaid est illud quod scatit, quod rapit, quod
vivit, quod viget, caeleate et divinam ob eamque rem aeternum sit acerrae rat. Nec
vero deae ipre...alio modo intellegi potest aisa· mear colata quaedam et libera, regre-
gata ab omni concretione mortali, omnia sentiam et mem, ipsaque praedita aratu
sempitemo cl. ib. 1 30, 36, 66, 63 (the Creator ie to the univerae aa Archimedes
