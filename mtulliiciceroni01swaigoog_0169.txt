observeais changed, the ind cause of book 11 (er comnwdis) being here
placed 3rd, as Cotta proposes to defer its consideration along with that of
the 4th cause, and no doubt both of these causes may be fitly considered
under the head of Providence‚ sc as to avoid the repetition occasioned in
the second book by the treatment of the same topic under different heads.
. But the question being whether the universe does or does not exhibit signs
of a creative and administrativa intelligence, Balbus is certainly justified in
protesting, as he does below, against the postponemcnt of his strongest
arguments and the assumption in tha meanwhile that the opposite has
been proved Itis possible that the subject was really thus divided by
Carneales, who of course had not the argument of Posidonius before him
to answer: he may have briefly considered the argument from comeum
and then gone on to examine the proof of the providential government of

the world

gical Theory of mythology advocated by Kuhn aud others, which is thus
stated by Max Mtiller (Lect. vol. 11 p. 519): ‘Olouds storms, rain, lightning
and thunder were the spectacles that above all others impressed the
imagination of the early Aryaus, and busied it most iu finding terrestrial
objecta to compare with their ever-varying aspect. .. The coming and going
of the celestial luminaries they regarded with more composure became of
their regularity ; but they could never cesse to feel the liveliest interest in
those wonderful meteoric changes, so lawless and mysterious in their
visitatione, which wrought such immediate and palpable effects for good
or ill on the lives and fortunas of the beholders’ (abbreviated).

ex constantia: this corresponds to the Solar Theory thus described
hy Max Miiller (p. 518): ‘I consider the regular recurrence of phenomena
an almost indispensable condition of their being raised, through the cherma
of mythological phraseology‚ to the rank of immortale, and Ι give e pro-
portionately small space to meteorological phenomena, such as clouds,
thunder and lightning, which, although causing for a time commotione in
nature and in the heart of man, would not be ranked together with the im-
mortal bright beings, hut would rather be classed either as their subjecte
or as their enemies'. For my own part I consider the Stoical theory, which
recognines both of these carmes, as well as the animiam of Tylor and H. Spen-
cer, to be truer and more philosophical than any of the partiel theorias.

dealing with a question of history not of philosophy, and is merely cited
