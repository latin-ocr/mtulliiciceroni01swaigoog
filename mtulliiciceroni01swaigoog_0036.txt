careless but capricious and for the most part quite indifferent to
making sensa. The first two I regard as honest but somewhat incom-
petent witnesseS, the writer of P has no intention to deceive, but his
inaccuracy almost amounts to dishonesty‚ while the writer of B, a
far more competent witness, as far as ability goes, is not satisfied
merely to repert, but deliberately sets himself to improve the read-
ings of the archetype. It is perhaps unnecessary for me to adduce
any evidence of the carelessness of APV, as that will be apparent to
any one who will glance over the readings of a chapter or two in
Orelli's edition, but I shall endeavour to show (1) that A and V are
independent of each other, but approach more nearly to one another
than to any of the other uss, (2) that B is connected with the arche-
type by adifferent line of descent from the others, and has frequently
preserved the true reading which has been lost by them, but that it
also alters the mistaken readings of the archetype so as to make
sense. The varying disarrangements in BPV seem to show that
these are mutually independent and are not copied either from A or
from the immediate ancestor oi A 3 and this conclusion is confirmed
hythe subjoined comparison of particular readings. Ihave compared
the readings for the 3rd book, as the uss are less imperfect for
this than for the earlier books. I give first those readings in which
the unaltercd A and V agree against Bc and P, taking no account
of Orelli’s dth codex E, belonging to the 15th century. In making
this comparison it must be remembered that it is only of APV
that we have the complete readings in Orelli's edition Where the
true reading is not that of AV it is given first in round brackets.
Readings conjectured enaiieniio in Orelli's apparetur criticae are put
in square brackets, asin tha critical notes.
