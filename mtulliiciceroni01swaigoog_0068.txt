That Carneades was the great source oi all criticism of Stoic
doctrines and especially 61 Stoic theology is evident from Cicero’s
own words N. D. 11 162 Carneades libenter ia Stoicos invehebatur, ·
Taso. v 83 contra Stoicos, quos studiosissime seraper resedebat et

might therefore assume a priori that the argument of the Third
Book was taken from him, even if it were 661 distinctly stated
in regard to Ι1116 proof that 66 6611661 can be eternal (111 29),
aud in regard to the sorites showing the impossibility 61 drawing
any line between the divine and human in the traditional my·
thology (11144). The same thing appears from the 9th book of
Sextus Empirious nav. Mart. where we meet with many of the
arguments used by Oicero. Thus 61 the commencement of the
discussion on natural causes, Sextus declares his intention not to
dwcll too much on points 61 detail or run 16 the immoderate
length 61 Clitomachus in refuting the dogmatists, but 16 sum up
the most important arguments on both sides and allow them 16
balance one another (1x 1). Α6 the whole discussion is 61 inte·
rest for this as well as for the earlier books 61 our treatise, it may
be worth while to give a short analysis, referring 16 the parallel
passages in the N. D. The positive argument is probably taken

in part at least from Posidonius, see introduction 66 the Sources
