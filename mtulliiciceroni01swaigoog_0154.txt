We find Ootta's dislike 01 reasoning on religion, his patroniaing of the old
tradition, exactly reproduced in the ‘Times’ 101 Aug. 23, 1879. “ Men 01
the world and especially statesmen are content to accept tradition as it
stands, to treat it with the respect which springs from customary rever-
01100 and historic feeling; but any attempt to make it the subject 01
inquiry or debate, 10 change it in reference 10 11110 disputed doctrine, 0110
defiantly flaunt it as the symbol of that new-fangled opinion, can only '

inspire them with grave sorrow at the strange and distortcd perspectiva 01
the theological mind.'’ Precisely what Ootta might have said 01 any
attempt 10 reform the religion 01 Rome.
