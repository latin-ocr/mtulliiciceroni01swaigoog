ἓ 54. Pierias O, pierius ABE, proelias P, pierides V. Here it
would seem that α must have had pierias, variously corrupted in PV3
O ie an easy emendation.

ἓ 65. consulantne di rebus humanis 0, for di the other-uss have de,
which is a very natural corruption of original di, and was probably
the reading of a, corrected by 0.

§ra qnod sumes, ‘quanio dissipes libamine 0E3 for dissipes
ABPV¹ have dissipis, V' dissipes. Here too I think it is essiest tc
regard O'e reading as a correction of dissipis.

ἓ 74. de fide mein tutele (for dee) O, deside fidem alam uide A,
de fide alluta tutelae B, de fide mule et utile PV, de fids mnia
tot utiles E. Here A must have arisen from a wrong divisiones
words (deficiam niet uteie) and a double dittographia effide and nt:
perhaps in α the line ended with et. Ithink it probable that here teo
O’sreading is an emendation, aa B’s certainly ia

ἓ 83. praee O, pravam all others. Probably amiculum was mis-
taken ior the diminutivo of annuus and so made masculine. O's read-
ing I take to be an emendation.

§Bb cuipiam nocuit Ο, quipiam n. A¹B, quippiam n. A'V
(nothing said oi E and P). Here I think the original reading was

probably quoipiam, corrupted to quipiam in n, and variously emended
by V and O.

ἕ 94. in eam OE, inarum (with r erased) A, in erem BP¹V¹, in
istam 1³⁹, in nurum V'. Here α must have had uam, OE are no
doubt corrected after A

True teat preserved hp P el .

ἓ 26. conformatum [P]‚ confirmatum others.

566. istm istac ibit PE (perhaps 13¹), istnc is meabit O, istuc
istu ibit AVB¹, isthaec marg. V same hand There can be no doubt
that Phere represents α, and that the form istnc being not very
common, got corrupted in ABV; the marginal reading of Vis pro
bahly an attempt to explain utne.

592. enarr, nasonia.

Igo on to give some crucial instances illustrating the character
of the different nea.

ᾖ 13. de Sapra. All the uss have gone wrong here, AOEPV
having sucre by inadvertence, but B changes this into sacris to suit

the conmxt.
