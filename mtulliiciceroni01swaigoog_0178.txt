1001111 011. x §26 85

There is no particular reason for these verbal distinctions here. But

Cicero was in Augustine’s phrase 0011011101 vigilantissimae appensor ac
= maner (cited by 'Irench on Worais Lect. 4), of which we have an example
111 the forms beatitas, beatitudo proposed by him in 1 95 ; still more in the
discussion on the word incedentia (Tusa. 111 20), non diei invidiam, qaae
tam est cane incidetur, ab inridendo aenam ineidattia recte dici potest 116
effugiamus 0111190100 nomen invidiae, qnod 01111110 dannan eat a nimis
1111111110 fortunam alterius, at est in Melanippo, and so on for some 1ines;
after which he returns 60 his subject,
intur: resumptive‚ see on 1 44.

111 eodem, quo illa: for the subaudition of the proposition with the ’

relative, when it has been expressed with the demonstrative, 000 above
131 n, Mayor on Cic. Ptii. 11 26,Madv.§aaaobs.1[e1s00n 111111,
Fabri on Liv. xx1133 ξ 9, Βο101 011 Cic. Off. 1 112. J. E. B. M.].

errore versentur: ‘have their being in the same error ', cf. 143 in
01001010 inconstantia versantur opiniones ,· 1 37 Aristonis magna in errore
1011106101 eat; Taso. 1 107 011101 quanto iaec in errore 0011006111 ‘what a
mistoke underlies all this'.

§26 praestabilius- =praes tantiae 11 16, 45 See below on patibiiem,
§26

00111 inter naturam et rationem intersit: ‘what e distance there n
between reason (such as we know it in man) and 6110 unconsoious opera·
tions of nature ². This refers both to the argument of Chrysippus 11 16
(in bomine solo est ratio 810.) and to that of Zeno just cited,

distinguitur: on the change from the Act. to the Pasa Swainson
compares Madv. Fin. 1148.

idemque: Cotta here separatas¹ the two arguments which are appa·
rently blended in 11 16, where see nn. He has just given the former ‘it
there is anything in the universe beyond man’s power 60 melre, that which
made it must be God': he now gives the latter, ‘if God does not exist,
there is nothing in the universe superior to man, · which is absurd'.

sint: Subj because subordinate to negat esse.

111-10111111οωὶ110θο00 melius: on the explanatory clause 111 apposi-
61011 60 Demonstrative 000 above § 7 si 111 est paneam.

Orionem et Caniculam: see nn. on 11 113. Canicst 10 hare used for
Sirius, as in Hor. 011.117,11113, 1106 for the Lesser Dog-star (Procyon),
as by Plin. ult. xum 68 cited on 11 114. As usual, Cotta confine 11911.
The question is not 11010 as 60 the divinity of each constellation, but as to
the rationality of the universe. Cotta's argument merely comes to thia,
there are parts of the universe which are irrational and unconscious and
therefore inferior to man.

01 domus—debemus: see 11 17 nn

aedificatum: ci. nn. on 1 19 0111111011 mandam, 1 4 jabrnati ; and for
