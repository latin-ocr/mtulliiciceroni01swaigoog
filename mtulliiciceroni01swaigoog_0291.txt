ol παλαιοὶ μάλιστα τᾶν (pier τὸν δράκοντα τοῖς ἥρωσι συνῳκείωσαν. At first
sight one is tempted to suppose 0116006006 must have adduced the case

of Cleomenes as a parallel to that of Metellus and of Drusus (N. D. 111 81),
good men abandoned to the melico of their enemies during their life
und only tardily vindioaled after their deaths But the fragment in all
probability belongs to the lost section 03 and the remark with which
Scaurus introduces his comment (modste, uam ait es 1116161110 dcc.) sug-
gests that 1116 quotation from (116616 must have been made 161 0116
purpose 61 illustrating the theory noticed by Plutarch We have already
met with allusione to spontaneous generation in 11 26 (n on s'prsa aa ee
96661606),ωὰ Lucretius uses this as a proof that no creatoris needed
(Π 865 ec immitibus οοιιιια principiae constare, the opposite to Balbus’ ab
6611161ιῶ61 percupide com (caturam) eree generatam, see l. 871 qacppe
videre licet vicos eca'stere berowe stercore dc taetro &c and 17831611). We
may conclude therefore that Ootta's reference to Cleomenes formed 6 part
of the argument by which he endeavoured to disprove the doctrine of an
intelligent first cause.

4. There seems no reason why this fragment should have been brack-
eted by Mn lt is true that much tho samo words are found in Off. 1 105,
but the providential care 61 man is the subject cf section D (cf. 11165), so
that Cotta could scarcely help saying something of 0116 kind.

5. For the 11691166 Annus 6661151 n. Thisis probablyapiece 616616-
166611666 6110116 part 61 Servius. We nowhere else read that it consisted of
3000 γ6616. 111 caenomanicae recorded both by Serv. on Acar 269
and 111 284, and by Tac. Or. 16, it was reekoned at 12954. Servius however
(1.6.) notices the inconsistency 61 0116 two estimates of Cicero in the words
(maguum acaum) de quo 66106 dabuntur 6 11160666 ef ab Eudoxo et a
Ptolemaeo et ab ipm Pollio.

6. The words of Servius are ‘spirabile'...eet sermo 0166166ιὶ6, quane-
qucm ille ιι1γ1ιί*ι’0<ιὶιι’(66 Thilo and Hagen with one 116 0 against the
majority of 0116 better 1166) dixerit ic libris de deorum cutura. Spiritalem
is the reading of B in N. D. 11 18, and though the form spiritualis is more
regular, yet we find the former in Vitr. x 1, and possibly we ought to read
it in (116616. Α6 161 spiritabiles, it is read by 11 and Red. in 11 18 (for spira-
1111611161 601161 Mss)and by the Paris codex 61 the 9th century in Tuae. 1 40,
11110 011616 6611 116 no doubt that this is merely a corruption, like acima-
auc, 6606161110, morabilis, aequabilis compared by Mu on Tusc. 1. c.

7. We naturally look to Book 11 142 foll. 161 this description of the
eyes, but nothing 61 the kind is said there. We only read that the 6616
have 611666 et quusi corneolos 1110161061, but this has no reference 06 0116
1661606666 61 cold. Possibly 06006 may have examined in detail the Stoic
panegyric on the wisdom shown in the structure of the body, andin doing
so remarked on this supposed use of the 6611166.
