poets and philosophus, and distinetly asserted even by Epicurus himself
§§ 61-65 (Ν D. 143, 11 5, 12, 111 1, 11, a 85, 86). 11 11 be said thatthere
is a similar consensus on the part 01 poets and the vulgar in regard to
the belief 111 Tartarus, yet that belief is aelf-contradictory, es may be
seen in the case 01 Tityus and Tantalus; for agony and immortality are
contradictory ideas. But there is no such inconsistency in the belief in
spiritual powers, We recognize that the spirit 01111011, which holds
together the body during 1110, 10 1101 dissipated 01 death, 1101 1100011110
upwards owing to its ethereal nature, and dwells in the lunar region,

neurished by vapours from the earth; if our spirit thus pasees into the
condition of a δαίμων, why should we doubt the existence 01 those

spiritual powers whom we know under the name of godel 11 66-74
(Ν. D. 11 5 011 Tartarus). (1) The material universe is evidently a work
ciart modelled and set in motion bya power which pervadas it, as the
seul pervadas the body. Is this power seli-movingl If n0t‚we go back
ad 1010110111. Itis therefore sslf-moving and has been so from eternity,

must itself be rationa13 man is a product of the power which pervadas
the universe, therefore 11101 power is rational §§ 77 (Ν. D. 1112). The
world is 0110, either in virtue of its original unity or from being composed
01 1110111101 parts, which may either have been compacted together as 0
ship, or remain separate, as 011 army. It cannot be 1110 101101, 101
whatever happens 111 one part is felt in another part, eg. the moon’s
influence in growth and in the tides (N. D. 11 19, 50, 119), and sympathy
01 thie kind belongs only 10 bodies originally united. Such 011 original
union may be either 11101 01 0011001011, as in wood or stone, or of growth
(φύσις, 11011110), 00 111 0 plant, passing in its highest stage 11110 0 unity
011110, as in animale. Things united by cohesion are scarcely liable to
change, but the universe undergoes constant and violent changes, 00110111
cold and 11001. It has therefore 0 unity 01 nature, and that of the best
11011110, since it includes all natures 111 11. Hence, since the whole

power, be inhabited by 0 divine order of beingsl ἕξ 86, 87 (Ν. D.

another, there must be some one which is best of all; 111011 10 best of 011
animale on earth, but, as we see, he is full of defeots; the true best is 011
00111101 with none of these defects end unapproachable by evil ; and such

is (lod §§ 88-91 (Ν. D. 11 16, 33-31). Argument 01 Socrates in
