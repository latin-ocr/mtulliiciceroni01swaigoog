Dionysius makes a sooffing allusion to the Greek custom 01 taking a sip of
unmixed wine and pouring a libation in honour of the giver of the grape
(ἀγαθὸς δαίμων) et the end of the first course, before the tables were removed
to make roem for the symposium ; ef. Aristopln aq. 85 ἄκρατον οἶνον ἀγαθοῦ
δαίμονος, Vesp. 525, Nicostratus (son of Aristophanes) in his eomedy
Pandrosos cited by Athela 1111693 ἀλλ’ ἐγχέασα θᾶττον ἀγαθοῦ δαίμονος
ἀπενεγκάτω μοι τὴν τράπεζαν ἐκ ποδῶν, lemeis κεχόρτασμαι γάρ· ἀγαθοῦ
δαίμονος δέχομαι· λαβοῦσ’ ἀπένεγκε ταύτην εἰε ποδοῖν, ib. 11 p. 38, Diod. IV 3.
Instead of the formida ἀγαθοῦ δαίμονος it was also customary to say
ὑγιείας (Becker Char. tr. p. 329). As the worship 01 ’Υγίεια was combined
with that of her father Asclepius, we may suppose that Dionysius on
entering their common temple would pour a libation to her, as a signal to
his servants to remove her table, which would probably be a votive offering
and might even have her name inscribed upon it.

Verres took marble tables from the temples (Cic. Vei-r. ιν 110).

Victoriolas: these were most commonly found with statues (hence
called νικηφόροι) 01 Zeus and Athene, see Mtiller 11110.Αο pp. 422, 465,

himself a worthy successor 01 Dionysius iu this as in other modes of
