Mr E. Μ. Thompson of the British Muscam has kindly examined
the volume for me and informs me that the original Oodex was
written in England towards the end of the l2th century. As there
are only three uss which are definitely stated tc be of an earlier
dato, vin the Vienna Ocdex V of the lOth century, the imperfect
Harleian Κ, and the Leyden Vossianus A of the llth, tc which we
may perhaps add the Palatino (P), cellcd permetietur in Baitcr’s ed,
it is evidently deserving cf a full collation*. The only other 5555
which can rival it in age are two others in the [cydon collection,
Orelli's B and 0 (Baiter's H) both cf the 12th century, and two
French uss which seem never tc have been colleted, one in the
National Librery at Paris no. 15085, said tc be written at the end
of the 12515 century, and cna in the Librery at Toum na 688, said to
belong to the same century. I mention these laet in the hopes that
I may be able to laarn further particulare about them from some
of my readers, and also that I may perhaps hear of other uss cf
equel antiquity which have escaped my notice. Halm in his pre-
face tc the Orellian edition cf the philosophical treatises of Cicero
mentions a Oodex of the llth century contained in the Munich
Library (us 528), but I am informed by Mr Reid that he can leam
nothing further about this from the present Librarian.

N otwithstanding his neat writing, the scribe is undoubtedly very
careless (1) in the division of words and sentences, (2) in mistaking
unccmmon for familiar words, (3) in repeating words cr clauses, ’
(4) in omissione arising from the recurrence of similar words or
syllables As exemplos of (1) Ι may cite quid jus for quidese 139,
c'n cita for aicitat 57, video for in dec167,fercaforcerec11166,
hoc diceretur piac 5555 for hoc diceret turpino 5555 1 70, invidia foria
India11142, quid doceam for quid Oceani 111 24, tam utiles for
medae 111 74. Exemples cf (2) are 55555155 soromatas 11129,
tn‘formis for Trophonicw111l9‚ celsos for caesios 1 83, tectim eo cde
for fhelxc‘noe Aoede 11154, et canet for Aeetam et 11155. Examples
of (3) are 111 17, where, instead of plurium 5 te Balbe dicta 5551, we
read plemma cum pulchitudine mwtdi B. d. 5., the words 5555-
mandc‘ being taken from a few lines below, where they followed
pulchra, which the copyist probably confounded for the moment with
plurima, and never corrected his mistake, if indeed he ever became

a For P and the Laurentian Codex 257 see the preceding Essuy cn Orelli's
uss.
