condemn the latter' m vr 56), cuum etium niujores uestri superati
tionem u reiigione sepuruoeuuit ,· while attha same time the fact that
he thinks it necessary tc claim the authority cf ancient usage ior his
own distinction, may perhaps be regarded as an indication that it was
not yet fully recognized. It was apparently unknown to the author
of the treatise ud Herennium, who couples reirpic with cratitio and
other passione which impel to evil (ιι 34); but it seems to have been
observed by all later writers. Thus, while Lucretius always uses religio
in a bad sense and never uses superstitio at all, his imitator Virgil
reserves relipio for what is laudable and speaks oi ouuu superstitio uete-
rumque ipuuru decim (Asu. vm 187), and so Horace reckons tristis
superstitio among the diseases of themind(Sut. 113. 79). Perhaps
it may be thought that the differenoe between Oioero and Lucretius
is not a difference of meaning as to the word religio, but a difference
of feeling and judgment as regards the facts denoted by the word.
Such a view would be quite consistent with the supposition that
Cicero’s dialogus is intended in part as a protest against the doctrine
advocated by Lucretius ; but Lucretius himself asserts more than
once that his doctrine is not hostile to religiones Cicero would under-
stand that word¹. In either case it seems to me clear that, while
agreeing with Lucretius as to the evils wrought in the name of religion,
Oioero wished to make it plain to all men that these evils did not
fiow from religion rightly understood, but from its corruption, which
he distinguished by the name of superstitio ,· and that an indiscrimi-
nate ettaok on all that went under the name of religion was even
more injurious to society than superstition itsels.

Assuming then that Oioero had this double practica] aim in
writing his treatise, first to eradicate superstition, second, to show
the importance of a rational religion ; and that he combines with
this the speculative aim os completing his system and expounding to
his countrymen the theologica] views of the leading Greek philo·
sophers, we have next to consider how this design has been carried
