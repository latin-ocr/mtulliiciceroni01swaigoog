wrong leaves As to actual losses, some bave attempted to account
lor these by supposing that the Christiana destroyed the argument
against Providenoe as impions, others relying on the statement of
Arnobius to the effect that some of the treatises oi Cicero caused
much scandal among the Pagans, have retorted the charge on the
latter* ; but there is no reason to have reoourse to either supposition.
The condition of the archetype, aa proved bytho transpositione in
Bk 11, is quite sufficient to account for the loss of other portions,
and we meet with similar phenomcna in the leges, the De Fato, the
Respublica, and other treatises. ,

These being the undoubted facts, as shown by all the uss, we
have next to inquire which of the uss best represent the archetypo
and what are their individual characteristica and their relations
to each other. The oldest ol the ress ol the N. D. is the Vienna
codex (V) of the lOth cent, bnt portione ol the treatise have been
preserved in a us of the 9th century described by Narducci, ol which

an account is given in the Jalcresbericlct siber d. Forteelcritte d.
chessisclcen Altertlcunmwissensciost for 1883, vol. 35, p. 75. The chief
lact of importance noted in regard tothis irs is that in book 11
it exhibite the samo dislocation as the other mss.

There is much resemblance between V and the Leyden codex (A) 3

of the llth century, which comes nearest to it in age. In both we
find careless mistakes, but very rarsly any signs oi an attempt to

alter tho reading in order to make sense, such as we shallsee reason to ,

suspect in BOE. The Palatino codex (P), which is called per-
antiquuet, is 1 presumo of about the same date as A. It is not only
