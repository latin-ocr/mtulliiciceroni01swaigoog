DESIGN AND EXECUTION OF ΤΗΕ DIALOGUE. xl

mankind from the yoke of superstition. If Lucretius describes the
state of the world, unenlightened by Epicurus, in the words bamaria

everlasting punishments of Tartarus as the climax of those terrers·
which kept men all their lifetime ‘subject to bondage’, Cicero makes
his Staio repudiate this as a superstition which was at length felt .
even hythe wulgar to be no longer endurable¹. Itis true that
Cicero does notin ourdialogue go so far as to speak of crimes per·
petrated in the name of religion, as Lucretius speaks os the sacrifice oi
Iphigenia: he is content here to show the folly and misery of super-
stition, and the inequity of the principles of action which it ascribes
to the gods 3 but elsewhere he contrasts it with religion, as a spurious

him he will sink below humanity u he can read Sallust's Empedocles’. It
is unneeessary to say more oi this translation than that it loses the force ot
tamea and uirum, as well as of the opposition between ciram and homiaem.
1 must cantion my younger readers against trusting too implicitly tc Mr Simccx
where he touches on other points which concern our present treatise. The
statement in 1 p. 80 that ‘Panaetius had adopted the orthodox doctrines of omens
and eracles instead ot the consistent and simple fatalism ot the earlier Stoica' is
exactly the reverse of the truth, as may be seen from the passages cited in p. xxi
oi my 2nd volume and the notes on 11 162, 16³, 111 93, 95 3 and Posidonius was
not a Peripatetic (as is stated in vol. 11 389) but one uf the most famous oi the
younger Stoica.
