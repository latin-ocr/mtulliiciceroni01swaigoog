from what preoedes. But in his note Mr Reid says “this must apparently
be added to the cxx. of the subj. used to denote coa id qaod fieret sodomae
eam, aad qaod fieri debuerat. As such passages are often misunderstood,
Inote that they can be most rationally explained as elliptic constructions
in which a condition is expressed without its consequence. We have an
exact parallel in English; ag. ta data, Albane, maneres may fairly be
translated ‘hadst thou but kept to thy word’. Here the condition ‘if

thou hadst kept' stands without the consequence ‘thou wouldest not have “

died’”. Itis tc be noted that in his commenta on these two passages
Mr Reid gives inconsistent explanations of the quotation from Virgil: in
the one place speaking of the protasis being understood (Ι suppose, ‘if you
had known it beforehand, you would have kept to your word ²), in the
other, of the apodosis. Probably we are to understand that he would
make two classes of jussive subjunctivae, those in which the apodosis, and
those in which the protasis is to be supplied, and that he would distribute
the cases under either head as he found it easiest to supply one or the

other. Mr Nixon (J. of Phil. vol. vn p. 57) says “it is not denied that
there is an important classof socelled ‘ jussive' subjunctivae, but of these

those with rae are intelligible imperatives (ae poposcisse) [on a subsequent
page this concession is withdrawn], those with raca can always be ex·
plained as hypothetica] with or without protasis suppressed ''. It appears
then that there are three points for consideration ι (1) is ne to be regarded
merely as equivalent to aaa? (2) is it the fact that the Latin Subjunctive
cannot mean ‘ought’l (3) is it possible to explain all ‘jussives’ as parts of
elliptic conditional propositione? As to (1), no doubt there are compounds
and phrases such as casas, nequaquam, in which aa retains its old simple
force, butI think we may safely assume that if ae continued to be used with
some one particular construction, however much the words were varied, it
must have been because it was felt that there was something in that construc-
tion which suited the later specialized use of ne. And whether, or not, we
employ the phrase ‘past imperative' it cannot be denied that the use of
rae in such a phrase as aa pepereram approaches moro or less nearly to the

Ἴ use of ae to express a wish (as in di rw dedieaeat above ξ 75), or a command.
. (2) It appears to me that the feeling of the Latin writers as to the meaning

of the J ussive Subj. is sufficiently shown, by its being frequently opposed
to dedeo and similar words, cf the instances cited above from Q. Fr. 111 4,
Philipp. 11 75, Liv. xnv 37, Verr. 111 195, dalla 25, Fin. 1135 si eam qaam
sauppe (voluptatem ductae), Mem tacere debuit ultimam teriaca· aia

Ἰ· also that we find the same meaning in other uses of the Subj. esp. in what
isknown as the ‘Deliberative’ use, with which the Jussive is coupled in

Tria. 134, cf. Mero. 633 quid apofacerem? (ln. qaid tc faceres mea’ rogas?
