ξ11. qussi vere-appellet: ‘as though any oi us gave the name of
Jove tc him whom you describe as sublime madeas, rather than tc the God
oi the Capitol'. Traditional mythology supplied the conscious belief of
the mma: so far Cotta is right; but the Stoics were right in regarding
that mythology as itself bearing witness to an older belief cut oi which it
had sprung. One chief source of that earlier belief in a superhuman Ruler
was the sight cf the heaven, its immensity, its splendour, its order, its
terror 3 and so far as mythology was associated with the religious instinct,
that old belief still survived under the forms of mythology: see passages

and their foolish heart was darkened'; the ignorant Roman deified the
image of Jupiter or Minerva, as his ignorant descendant in the present
day deifies the image oia Saint or a Madonna Thus it was thought
that one image would be jaalous of the honour done to another image of

the same God, cf. Suet. Oct. 91 cum dedicatam iu Capitolio aedem Tonanti 1

Sext. Emp. 111 63 foll ‘not only the mass, but the wisc, the poets and
