nature. If we set aside these idiosyncrasies, the question 111100,
with which 01 the other uss is this most closely connected I think
the instances given below, which might be multiplied to any extent,
‘ show conclusively that itis very nearly allied to the oldest known
codex, Orelli's V, written in the lOth century, and to the Harleian
Oodex 5114 Μ, written in the latter hali of the 15th century. To
the same group belong the Roman and Venetian editions of 1471.
The relation in which it stands to Orelli’s V is curicus. Where
there is a second reading in V, this is usually followed in the Merton
Oodex (0111),111111101111111)1 means universally, not in general
where it is specified that the correction or marginal reading in Vis
written 1111111110 mana, as in 11 69, where Ψ has the correct deflagra-
visec, while 011. agrees with Vl 1111110 reading deam 1019101110.
Sometimes an older reading is preserved 111 011, which has been cor·
rected in V, thus in 11 18 Oxi. has appareat and 111 cogitari, where
V has by correction apparet and 1110 00911011 ,· in 11 56 V has 1111111-
lita by correction, while Oxf. with UOR retains, what was probably
the original reading 01 V, 10 mentita. Sometimes both readings are
combined, as 11111 27 where Ψ has 111 fervescant, Ψ offerateum, 011
eis 1110100001· 11127 where Ψ has 0111111, Ψ 11101111, 011. inaurea
11101011. Sometimes we observo a general resemblance combined with
slight and probably accidental variation, as 11111123 where AB¹V¹
have data elephantos (doubtless representing an original 1011101001),
corrected 10 d. elephanto in 13⁹, to d. elephantia in PV'HMR, and to
d. elephanti in 0xf.; in 11 146, where ABEP read 11 postte leopardi,
V by corr. 11 afric 1011910111, end 011. 0111 11 1011910111’; 11111 42,
where ΒΟ rightly give id 11, and A¹PV¹ id 111, Ψ has 1111111111,
Ε 1111111, and Oxf. MRGV idemque. The conclusion to which these
things point, seems to be that Oxf. was copied from V at a time
when some, but not all the corrections, which are now found there,
had been made. One would like to know whether Orelli’s ‘seranda
manae’ always denotas the same handwriting and, if so, what is its
(11101. Α1 the same time there are occasional difficulties 111 the way
of this hypothesis: for twenty cases, say, in which Oxf. agrees with
V against the rest of Orelli's uss, we find one, it may be, in which
Oxi. approaches more nearly to some of them than to V. Thus in
11 86, where Baiter reads arserant, AO bave 11 fama, B haec faceat,
