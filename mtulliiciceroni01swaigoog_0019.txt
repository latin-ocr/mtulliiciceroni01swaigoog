The same idea seems 10 be imphed in the phrase used (N. 111 1)

Again, as the evil deplored by both writers is the same, so is the
remedy proposed, which is in a word the scientific theory 01 nature,
religio quoe est junceta 0001 cognitione nutnrue (Die. 11 149), the
physico corestunsqne ratio, which is opposed 10 superstition in N. D.
111 92, 11 63, De'o. 1 1263 in the words 01 Lucretius 1 146 11000 101101·

(1101 discutiunt, sed naturae species ratioque. Fruther we find both

writers agreed as 10 the fact, that the Divina existence is not incon- ¹

religious belief among mankind from the awo-inspiring phenomena

From this point however the two writers draw spart. Cicero
accepts us valid the above-mentioned grounds 01 religious belief and
adds 10 them the general consent 01 mankind, the traditional 101111
01 Rome, the marks 01 intelligcnce and 01 benevolenoe visible in the
universe ; while he ridicules the solitary evidence on which Lucre
tius appears to build his theology, that 01 dreams, and shows how
arbitrary and inconsistent is the Epicurean idea 01 the ‘intermundiun'
gods³. To the 1011111010 001001100 01 atoms and the fntnnu guber·
nans 01 Lucretius he opposes the prwidmnu gubernans 01 the stoice.
Lastly, while it is religio which is the curse 01 mankind according to
Lucretius, with Oicero it is 1000011110· 0101 and over again he dis·
tinguishes the one from the other, as the lawinl from the unlawful,
the rational from the irrational, the holy from the unholy, and sums
up in tha words, itu facturn est 10 superstitioso et religioso alterurn

distinction has the air 01 remonstrance against a misuse 01 the
