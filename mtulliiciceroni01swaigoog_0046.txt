RELATIONSHIP OF MSS. xxxix

5 46. fanum eat BPV‘, fanus eat AcV¹ (in A a erased), fanum
E. Probably a had fanu at, corrected in BP.

547. lucus AEVB', lucos P making it the object of interpretor, ·
lucia B¹ perhaps to suit Attenia, locus O.

551. Aequi A¹PV¹, arcui B, arcus A'V', urci OE Arquiis
plainly the reading of a, of 'which the others are corruptions

5 56. dapum dicuur interemisse [A2Bclr], arquatum d i. A¹PV.
Probably a had an abbreviation, misread by the first recension (β),
but rightly interpreted by B and emended by O.

Aeppptum profupiaae [OE],. aeyyptum prp‘uiaae AB¹V¹‚
aegypto praefuisse B²PV⁹. Ithink a must have agreed with ABV,
and that 0 and P are emendations.

5 64. duamur indipuu naturis Madv, conj„ divalium ἱφιαίθ
AOPV, diaulia usu ipueia V', dicamus dipnaie de dpa R, dicamus
digandin Β. As m, u, u and a· are frequently interchanged in the
usa, there is no difficulty about the first word, but how are we to

explain the change from indigua maturis into u ipaaia? The last ·

syllable is an abbreviation for naturis, so the problem is how to
change iudipuuuaia into u ipuais. The disappearance of the repeated
ua explains itself and we are left with u followed by hiatus to repre-
sent iud. If this is a correct account of the readings in ncPV it is
plain that B and E are merely conjectural.
per mare BPV and (with re on erasure of four letters) A,
permanere OE and probably A).
5 65 fin. ni ob rem (see my n), ui orbem V, niobem AO'E, niobe
B 3 iu jovem 0¹, uu iobem P, om. edd. with some inferior uss. No
one has attempted to offer any explanation of the oldest readings 3 it
has been assumed that N iobe in B was a glosa giving the name of the
speaker, but why in the world should Niobe have been selectedl

If ui obrem were the reading ol a, this would naturally be changed .

into the more familiar ui orbem or Niobam, and B would naturally try
to make sense by dropping the m.

569. pestifera eat multis admodum paucis adutaria. Instead ol
ea'A1BEPV1 have aiut, OA²V² ait, in place of the original at,· B
retaining the plural mends the grammar by reading salutaria. ³
' 570. nocere Deianira uoluit AOFAEV, u. Dianae ira uoluitBby
an ingenious emendation.

572. uec amet BPA⁹V², necari et A¹V¹cn Iahould suppose
that B represents α, misread by β and corrected by· P.

5 74. daec cotidiana, aicae, uenena AOEPV, Ιι. c. sica uB

(altering the number to make it agree with cotidiana). Ι
