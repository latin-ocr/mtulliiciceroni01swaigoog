by Python ’. Perhaps Silari filias has been lost atter quartas. Nowhere
else do we read that he was the legislator of Arcadia or born there.
Lagislation was however regarded as an office of the Delphian Apollo, cl.
Plat. Ilep. IV 427. (we leave to Apollo at Delphi) τά πε μέγιστα καὶ κιίλλιστιι
κοί πρῶτα τῶν νομοθετημάτων...οῶος γὰρ δήπου ὁ θεὸς περὶ τὰ τοιαῦτα πᾶσιν
ἀνθρώπως πάτριος ἐξηγητὴς ἐν μέσῳ τῆς γῆς ἐπὶ τοῦ ὀμφαλοῦ καθήμενος
ἐξηγεῖται, Leyy.1 632 ἰν τοῖς ποῦ Διὸς λεγομένοις νόμοις τοῖς τετοῦ Πυθίου
Ἀπόλλωνος, οὓς Μίνως πε καὶ Λυκοῦργος ἐθέτην, ἔνεστι ταῦτα πάντα, Diod.
1 94, Strabo xvr 38, eie. Die. 1 36. So above Mercury is called the
legislator of Egypt.

§58. prima lovis et Proserpinae: Ampelius is the only other
writer who gives this parentage. Artemis is however sometimes identified

both with Persephone-and Hecate, as in the Orphic hymn cited by Porphyry
ap. Euseb. Pr. Ee. 1v 23 ἥδ’ ε’γοί είμι Κόρη πολυφιίσμοτος κ.τ.λ.; and we have
had many cxx. of the confusion between parent and child, eg. ξ 53 on
Proserpina ’

pinnatum cupidinem: Pausanias (rx 27) says that Olen calls Eileithyia
(ie. Artemis, see on 11 68) mother of Eros. The winged Eros is spoken oi
by Plato Plaeclr. 252, Eur. Hipp. 1270, Aristoph. Aa 574 and 697, where
the Scholiast says that it was only in later times that Eros and Victory
were represented with wings.

pater Upis: this is another mythologice] ἄπ. λεγ. According to
Herodotus (ιν 35) Opis and Arge were two Hyperborean maidens who
came to Delos with Apollo and Artemis, and were invoked by the Delian
women and the Ionians generally in a hymn composed by Olen. In the
pseudoPlatonie Aaioclla p. 371 we are told that the Magian Gobryas was
shown two brenen plates at Delos, giving an account of what beiel the seul
after death, and that these platea were said to have been brought there
from the Hyperboreans by Opis and Hecaergos. In Oallim. Dian. 204
Opis is addressed ae olm dancc’ ιῦιῖπι φαεσφόρε, κοί δέ σε κείνης Κρηταέες
κυλίουσιν ἐπωνυμίην ἀπὸ νύμφης, where see spanheim also ib. 240;
Macrob. Sal. v 223 Serv. ad Aea. ιιι 532 alil palari: Opim et Hecaergon
amrdcrea Apollinis el Dianae faisse: liae Opim ι’μιοπι Dianam, Apollinem
acro Hecaergon. We do not elsewhere find Opis or Upis regarded as
masculine. Callimachus (Del. 292) makes her a daughter of Boreas, and
gives her two sistens Loxo and Hecaerge; Virgil (Aea. ιιι 532 and 836)
introduces her among the attendant nymphs of Diana; Palaephatus
(Incred. ξ 32) says it is a Lacedaemonian name ior Artemis3 finally
we read in Athen. x1v 10 that hymns to Artemis were called οὔπιγγοι
The name is generally derived from ὅπιςτνέμεσις, but Preller explains it
as ‘the eye oi night ³, ie. the moon. of Glauce we do not read elsewhere
in this connexion.

' primum J eve et Proserpina: so Ampelius and Lydus in Appendix.
'l'he latter cites Terpander the Lesbian as the authority for the tradition.
