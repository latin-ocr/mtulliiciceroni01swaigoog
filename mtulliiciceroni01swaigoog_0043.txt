the lst recension (β) should have gone wrong then that B should ¹

have corrected ατίιιιπι ’

uss havefelie, filice, nummus, in Pamphylia <bc I have sometimes

thought thatfeliae andfilio might both be corruptions of γαζοφύλαξ, l
that being the office held by Harpalus at the court of Alexander, but
il so, several words must hove been lost It does not seem possible ’

thatselie should have been an emendation of filia, so that we must
in any case recognize here again two recensione of σ.

manubiis, BE02, moechiis ie ΑΡ, moechiis iia V, cannitiis 0¹.
Here I should think the reading of AP is that of the lst recension
of a, arising from dittographia of is, V's reading would be a natural
correction of this.

584. qood quisque socri habent B (so Ba), q. q. a onereb le.
AOEPV. Here it hardly seems possible for the one reading to have
grown out of the other by inadvertence, and as there was moreto
tempt an intelligent scribe toalter the latter than the former reading,
I am inclined to consider seori an emendation.

io tyrannidis repam B, io typeeidis rogem AEPV, in

timpaoide'e rogum O. If my view ol the passage is right (see n. in p
loc), several words are omitted owing to homoeoteleuton3 B has pre- 2

served tyrannidis, but altered at into e'o with all the other uss

§aa saepe dicti 0, dixi ABEPV. Itis easy to understand an ¹

ignorant or careless scribe writing diei for dixti, but bow are we
to account for Ol Is it directly copied from α, or is it a correction,
not needing very much acuteness, of a wrong traditional readingl

541. io monte Oetaeo Ο, io monte Ιφηοοειιεο AEPV, in monte
oeetaeo B. I have suggested that the prevalent reading may have
originated in in montem oetaeum wrongly divided. If so, O’s reading
is an emendation.

§la occepimus OEV', accipimus ethera An easy emendation.

552. altiliorum OEV', citit bonorum ABV¹, ee. bonorum P.
The abbreviatione othonorum, bonorem and dmum are easily con-
fused, the only question is how O got the right reading. I think by
emendation or by copying from V'.
