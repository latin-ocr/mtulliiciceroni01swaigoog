tect, must have had some material to work on, end that this materiei
must have had properties of its own3 similarly we may assume that, when
he made plante und animale, he must have had, as his material, the four
elements of which they are compounded'. Lactantius distinctly denies
the first assumption (11 8§ 8), ποιηο quaerat οο quibus istu πιαιονιῗὶς tam
magna, tam mirifica opera Deus feceret. Omnia euim fecit οο nihilo ,· ποο
audiendiam poetae qui aiunt chaos in principio sciere...portea cero Deum
insuevisse mandam ,· then, after citing this passage to show that the philo
sophers are no wiser than the poets, he goes on to argue that “if God did
not make matter, he must be inferior to the maker of matter, which is-
equivalent to saying that the maker of matter is the real eod 1 Or, if it
be said that it exists by nature, then nature must be rational, but a
rational and creative nature is only another name for God. Cicero's eom-
parison ignores the difference between God and memsam eieci aliquid
amcitiam, sifacem eet quidquam ιιοιι ab illo, jum potestatem Dei et αοπιομ
ammei. If it be said that matter is eternal, there must be two contending
eternals, which is impossible, or God must be derived from matter, the
rational and voluntery agent from that which is without will and con-
sciousness &c.” Of. Theodorei: p. 64 (ἦ γραφὴ) δημιουργησαι τὰ ξύμπαντα

3. This is taken from Scaurus, a Virgilian commentatores the time
of Hadrian, who in his note on Aea. v 95, where Aeneas is represented as
doubtful what to think of the snake which issued from his father's tomb
(ι’ποοτιοι desierim loci famalcmrw pareretis esre putet), writes as follows:
eruditu nam ait ιο musclis corporum aegaee earu. He then cites
Persius pinge druos αομνοι, and, after a short· hiatus, refers to the story 01
Cleomenes, the reforming king of Lacedaemon, as told by Cicero. There
can be no doubt that the allusion is to what is recorded in Plut. tieem. 39

he hung on the cross, and guarded it from obscene birds. This was taken
as a sign that (11 was beloved by the gods and was himself a hero and
