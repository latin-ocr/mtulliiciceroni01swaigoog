The Stoic might answer ‘I find the mass guided in their conduct to a
certain extent by religious sanctiens. These sanctiens are closely con-
uected with their forms of worship and sacred traditions. In sofar as the
latter involve the belief in an all-wisa Ruler of the universe, in οο far they
are right. But at present they are mixed up with much which is shocking
to reason aud conscience. We wish 10 make people feel that this is only
the 00101 husk of the truth, that the truth is deoperlying and distinct
from its shell or huslc (This distinction was marked by the opposition
between τὸν ἀμέριστον cal τὸν μεμερισμένον νοῦν Firm. 7, where 000 Oehler3

and the phrase in Lydus lv 48 nris bi κατὰ τὸν ἡρωϊκὸν xci μεριστὸν λόγον ,

τρεῖς Aias εἶναι βούλονται... πολλοὶ έκ τοῦ ὅλον Διὸς Δίοι, ὥσπερ Ἀπόλλωνες
ἢ Διόνυσοι.) After a time they may perhaps get rid 01 the husk altogether.
Meanwhile you bring it as a charge against us that the traditions differ.
That is all iu our favour : it helps to show the unimportance of the husk’.

rival claims of different divinitieS, are all in favour 01 the Brahmo Somaj. ’
The argument of Cotta was employed with more justice by the Christiana l

against the vulgar polytheism, as by Amobius 11 16, Firm. 15,16, Olem.

The phrase is similarly used 01 Volumnius Fara 11133 §a The word
implies the opposite to that which is superficial and commonplace, and
in philosophy is opposed to ἐξωτερικά, as Cicero understood that term
