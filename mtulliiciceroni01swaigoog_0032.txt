WAS THE NATURA DEORUM PUBLISHED DURING THE
LIFE-TIME OF CICEROl

In the preceding essay indicatione of hasty composition have been
pointed out, and it has been remarked that some passages present the
appearance of having been made up of two alternative versione of
the same original, both of which have been inserted by mistske. If
this is so, it would seem that the book must have been published
without the authors revision. Are there any facts which would
confirm this suspicioni
⁴ The conclusive proof that the book did not receive the finishing
touches from the hand of its author, is to bo found in the inconsistent
allusione to the time occupied in the discussion Thus, in 11 73 we
find the conversation of the lst book alludcd to in the words o teipso
hesterno die dictum est, and in 111 18 the 2nd book is alluded to in
the words omnio quae o te nudius tertios dieta suat 3 from which we
should infer that the whole discussion must have occupied four days,
giving one day to each speech. But il we look back tc the beginning
of the and and 3rd books (quoe cum Cotto dixisset tum Velleius 11 1,
quae mm Balbus disiisset tum arrideas Cotto 111 1), we find no hint
of any break in the conversation. The only reference to timo is in
111 94 quoniam advesperascit dubis nobis dam aliquem ut contro isto
dicamus, which certamly implica that the conversation had occupied
only one day. There is no difficulty of this kind in other dialogues.
In the Tusculana (1 8) Cicero distinctly says darum quimus scholas
iia totidem libros contuli, and there is a formal notice ol the close of
one day and the beginning ot another in 1 119, 119, 10, 11 67, 1117,
111 84, 1v 7, v 1, ll, with a separate dedication cr preface to each
book. In the De Finibus the first two books are supposed to be
spoken ccntinuously at Cicero’s villa at Cumae, the 3rd and lth on
a different occasion at Lucullus' Tusculan villa, the cah in Plato's
Academia at Athens. ’
