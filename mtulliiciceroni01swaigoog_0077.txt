a professed philosopher was iar less likely than Cicero to be tied te
one authority; and we have already seen that, where Sextus and
Cicero are both copying Carneades, Cicero occasionally supplies
details which are wanting in Sextus. Ι have myself little doubt that
the whole argumentation 01 the 3rd book is taken 11011 clito
machus.

A further question may be asked as to the original author 01 the
mythological section, which I presume to have been included in the
treatise 01 Clitomachus In the Appendix on that section it is
suggested that it may have come from Mnaseas. Clemens Alex-
andrinus, quoted underAp0110, names Aristotle as his authority,
but this is supposed by Rosa (Arist. Pseadepipraphus p. 615 1011) 10
be a mistake 101 Aristocles, a contemporary of Strabo. One can
scarcely imagine that any philosopher would take the trouble to
make 0111 such a catalogue 01 mythological inanimes, but it would be
an appropriate work 101 an erudite Alexandrian Euhemerist, such as
Mnaseas, and might then be seized upon ior polemieal purposes hythe
Academica, whom Timon 1011111111101πλο1ορημοσύνην ἀνάλωτον

EDIT10NS AND ILLUSTRATIVE WORKS.

As regards the text, the Orelli-Baiter edition of 1862 rendere
all that precedes obsolete; but an editor is bound to remember
with gratitudo the names of those who contributed most to raise
the text from the state in which it was left by Ascensius in 1511
10 that in which it now appears. If we take the lat edition oi
Davies' (Oamh. 1718) as our dividing line, Victorius, Paulus Manu-
tius, Lambinus, Ursinus and Gulielmius (the last in Gruter-'s ed 01
1619) may be named, among the earlier editors, as those who did
