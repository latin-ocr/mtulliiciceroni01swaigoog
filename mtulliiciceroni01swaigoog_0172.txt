noos 111 cs. viu §tu 79

ξ 20. nullos esse: ‘that they were non-existent', see Index.
a consuetudine: see 11 45 (commencing the second section of the argu·
ment) in reference to the difficulty of conceiving Gods in other than human

shepe. Chrysippus wrote a treatise against Oustcm, κατὰ Συνηθείας, Plut.
lior. p. 1036.

quo nihil mellus esset: cf. 11 46 mando uatem certe atil ert nullas.
The Subj. is due to Orat. Obl. (Roby §1740) ‘than which, you said, nothing
is tter '.

&hrode possemus: (that might be the case) ‘could we but imagine the

world to be alive ¹. For similar ellipsis cf. atsi forte 1 98, nisi aero below
til, Roby ξ 1626. ·

l 21. quid dicis meliust ‘what meaning do you attach to that
wordl' lit. ‘what quality do you call by that name l‘ cf. 1 89 qaid cat ⁴istac
gradatim?

si pulchrius: as asserted in 11 47, 58, of the mundane sphere.

eutius ad utilitates: as shown in 11 49.

sapientioris in 1147 and more particularly in 11 36, 39.

nullo modo prorsus: Madv. on Fin. 11 15 says thatprorscc, when joined
with the negative in whatever order, always increases its force, as in Plaut.
Tria. 730 eaeo modo potest fleri prorm qaia dos datar ; see Munro on
Lucr. 1 748, where aec prorsam=et procace aon. Soh. wrongly asserts the
sama of aon omnim, which, like οὐ πάνυ, is found either in the weak or the
strong signification, noa being sometimes used to negative the adverb,
as in Plaut. Asia. aon omnino jam perii; eat reliquom qao peream magia ;
and eie. Art. 111 23 ξ 2 aon omnino quidem sed mopacm partem.

uon quod difficile sit: the Subj. marks that the reason assigned is not
vouehed for hythe speaker. See Roby ξ 1744.

eh. nn nihil eet mundo melius: the argument, given in 11 21, 46,
is borrowed ultimately from Plato Tim. 30: ‘The Creator sought to make
all good and beautiful in the highest degree, and perceiving οὐδὲν ἀνόητον
τοῦ νοῦν ἔχοντος ὅλον ὅλου κάλλιον ἔσεσθαί ποτ’ ἔργον, νοῦν δ’ αὖ χωρὶς ψυχῆς
ἀδύνατον παραγενέσθαι τῳ, he therefore made the world ζῷον ἔμψυχον ἔννουν
π’. (lottais right in complaining of the vagueness of the argument of
Balbus, but his comparison is illegitimate, as sch. observes3 since the
relation oi reram actara to mundae is a relation of identity, while that of
terroe to arta aestro is a relation of whole to parts. As to the particular
companson, it is of course absurd to speak of the material city as being
better than any thing on earth. A single human being, a single object
possessed of life is better and more wonderful. If on the other hand we
mean by the city a. community oi men, we may then think of it as the
highest thing on earth, but this will only be because we regard it as the
highest earthly embodiment of reason.

ue in terris quidem: like οὐδέ, ac qnidam has two nenses, a stronger
anda weaker; here it is the latter, ‘neither is there anything on earth
