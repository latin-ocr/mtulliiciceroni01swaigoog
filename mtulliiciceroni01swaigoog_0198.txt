Cicero here (cf. Theodoret qa. 55 in Oeace. ἀβελτερίας γὰρ ἐσχάτης τὸ ἐσθιό-
μενον προσκυνεῖν) is with justice adduced by Duille (De reliqebsi cultus
οίγόαίο 11 c. 4) asa proof of the novelty of the doctrine. [Of. Baylo s. v.
11551055 a. H. J. E. B. M.]

quos: this is cited by Roby ξ 1743 as an instance of the Relative
used for qaod with Demonstrative. Perhaps it may be explained more
simply by saying that the Antecedent de 511 has to be supplied with
reddes.

tn reddes: ‘it is for you to explain how that could be'. For the
Imperative force of the Fut. cf. ta 01515515 Fam. 1v. 13 §4; 5501 calchas

id fieri potuerit: in place of pervenire potuerim.

fieri desierit: (ists practice with regard to his daughter Tullia (on
which see 1 9 n), and the subsequent prevalence of apotheosis under the
Empire show that 00555 is not here representing either the general belief
or O.'s own feeling. ¹

Ribbeck (Trogi nel. p 3411) compares Eurip. Ηοναοί. 910’ εστιν ἐν οὐρανῷ

β βακως τεὸς γόνος, ὦ γεραιά, φεύγει λόγον ως τὸν Αιδα δόμον κατέβα, πυρὸς

the ¹I'lu'loet 5155 of Accius. ·

Homerus· we have a similar ref. above ξ 11, 50 prove the mortality of
Pollux„ The passage here referred to (Οαί. 111600) 0511110555 said to prove
the point at issue : according to the existing text it recognizes a divine, as
well as 5 1111111511, Heracles; τὸν δὲ μέτ’ εἰσενόησα βίην Ἡρακληείην, εἴδωλον,

- αὐτὸς δὲ μετ’ ἀθανάτοισι θεοῖσι τέρπεται ἐν θαλίης καὶ ἔχει καλλίσφυρον

Ἥβην, The verses were however obelized by Aristarchus, (1) because they
are inconsistent with Il. xvm 117 οὐδὲγὰρ occist, Ἡρακλῆος φίνγε κῆρα...
άλλά ἔ μοῖρ’ ἐδάμασσε καὶ ἀργαλέος Xoites Ἥρης, (2) because the distinction
between soul and shade 151111-Ηο1115110, (3) because Hebe is a virgin god-
dess in the Iliad. The lines were attributed by some to Onomacritus,
see Nitasch ia loc. They gave rise to much speculation on the part of
the Neo-Platonists, cf Lucian's amusing dialogus between Diogenes and

Heraclea.
