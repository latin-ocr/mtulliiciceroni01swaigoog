xxxviii mrnonncrsos.

5 14. commemorabas BPV', commorabor AOEV'. Here I think
AOV represent α corrected in BP.

ἓ 15. audisi,· tibi si AOV, aedicit qaam ei (paam in res.) B,
aedicit. tm sc' Ρ, audivi Bis se E. The origin oi the wrong readings
is misdivision (audivit ibici), which is corrected with intelligeres by
B and P, and without sense hy F.

516. mnus ie eodm est AOEPV', for is V¹ has by a common
mistake bie, which B alters into ex bis to make sense.

ἓ 18. quoniam esset aliquid io sermm maturo...esse aliquid ³

bomine aeolius AcP V, q. esset aliquit bominem aliquid im reram dzc.

(si superscr. before esset) B, the eye oi the copyist passing from the
lst to the 2nd alequid, and then ei being inserted to give a construc-

tion ; E hos m' esset aliquod.

519. ab bec eo questmsw...separammrABPV, αι om OE (mis- κ

taking it for a superfluous ebl. sing).

ἓ 25. aram Bon, erased A, cromam V¹, arenam V', aram aut P.
The sanctiss here cen be best explained by supposing a dittographia
in c, altered in V end P to get some approach to sense. The correct

reading wes an easy emendation.
326. aedificatum AOEPV, aedificatum esse B Mn Sch. The

insertion oi esse is an easy emendation, which to my mind rather spoils ,

the rhythm of the sentence.
527. maturae isto OEPV, maturae ste A, maturo istae B. Pro

bably B is a correction of a, represented by A, ste being carelessly ’

written for slah
531. mollis est OEV', mo V¹, melleet A¹‚ osolest 13¹, molle est

Amr. nere a probably nae ose abbreviem moos, wesen as ἱ
one word by A, omitted as a monstrosity by V, and altered to the ³

. more familiar molest by B.

ἓ 43. meliora me didicisse...copedmmculis...quam rationibus: f

thia isthe reading of all the nss, but O adds refersit to find a govern-

ment for quom, which it takes for the relative.
Pamisos ABPV, Panes OE.

545. sanctissume colunt (with one letter erased before colant) Ἰ
V, sanctissime ceolum A, sanctissimum colunt E, remotissimae colunt ,

P, sanctissime eolmmt Bc, Here probably V (and a) had sanctissume

eoelum hy dittographia of e, this was variously understood by A and
P end emended hy BOE.

’ Deiter (Ro. Mea. lese p. 314) gives naturae istae ee the true reading of B.
