But does not Cicero himself speak cf the De Natura Deorum as
already published nt the time os bis writing the De Divinatione, and
the De Fotol Compare Dio. 1 8, where Quintus says perlegi tuum
poulo onte tertium de notura deorum in qno disputatio Cottae, pesam
quom hebefactuoit sententium onom, non funditus tomen anteiit, to
which Marcus replies Optime vero, etenim ipse Cotta oio disputat, ut
Stoicorum mauis argumenta confutet quom leoninum debut religionum.
Quintus regards this protentus e matter of form dicitur quidem istuc
no communio juro migrare ridentum sect studio contro Stoicos dis-
sereruti deos milri videtur funditus tollere: ejus rationi non sune
deciduo quid respondeum· sotis enim dffercao religio eat in secundo
libro a Lucilio, enjus dispunctio tibi ipsi, ut in extremo libro scribis,
ud vudutem est eriso propensior. Again in Dio. 11 3 quibem rebus
editis (ie. the Hortensius, Academico, De Finitus, nmmum), tres
libri perfhoti scint de uotiua deorum ,· to which he adds others after-
wards. It may be thought that these quotations settle the question
snd that Cicero himself is responsible lor the book inite present
state whether finished or unfinished. But is it not permissible to
drew a different conclusion from the opposition of the words editi
and perfecti in the lust passagel The Hortensius and other dialogues
were published‚ the N utura Deorum was whst we should cell ready
for the prees. So in Fot. 1 1 we find a distinction made between
quod in otiis libris seri qui eunt dr notura deornm, and the books
quos de divinatione edidi. We are not bound to take literally the
statement that Quintus had read the book of which he is supposed to
speak in Dio. 1 ; evenis hebed done so, it might have been from having
aceess to the originalem. We know that other works of Cicero were
published after his death, such as the Epistles and probably some of

· the Oratione by Tiro, and, among his philosophieal werke, the un-

finished Lepos. If the Notiora Deorum was still unpublished at the
time of Cicero’s murder, and if the ns was ns much altered and
amended ss that of the De Gloria, of whioh he says to Atticus (xvr 3)
misi ἀρχέτυπον ipsum crebris loeis inculcatum et resectum, this would
go iar to explain the existing roughnesses and inconsisteneies of the
dialogus.
