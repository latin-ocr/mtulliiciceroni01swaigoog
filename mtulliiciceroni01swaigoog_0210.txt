pyre hy Hermes ³, cf. below ξ 57 on the second Aesculapius, But we no·
where else (except in the parallel passage from Arnobius given in the
Appendix) find Trophonius identified with Hermes, or represented as the
son 01 Ischys and Coronis. He is the son of Erginus or of Apollo (Pausan.
1x 37, Hom. H. Apoll. 296, Schol. on Aristoph. Noe. 508), and is himself
entitled Zeus Trophonius (see on § 49) as being connected with the unseen
world, just as heis here entitled Mercury, ie. Ἐρμῆς Χθόνιος. The con·
fusion between Troph. and Asclep. seems 10 have arisen from some
resemblance in the rites with which they were worshipped, on which see
Pausan. rx 39. Where the discrepancy from the common tradition is in
any ease so great, there seems no justification for changing the us reading
Phoronidis into Ooroor'riia Ovid uses the patronymic Ptoroair for Ie,
as being a descendentes Phoroneus (1111111124), king of Argos. He
makes (l. 569) Coroneus (Dr L. Schmitz in Dici. of Ast. reads Phoroneus),
not Phlegyas, the father 01 Coronis. Again Strabo tells us (x p. 471) that
Hesiod mentioneda daughter 01 Phoroneus, from whom were deseended the
mountain nymphs and the Curetes. Phoronis is also the name of one' of
the lost Epics of Graece, in the fragments 01 which there ‘is a reference 10
Hermes and the Idean Dactyls (Lobeck Ayl. 1157).

qui sub terris habetur idem Trophonius: ‘the subterranean deity
who is also believed to be Trophonius’. The parallel in Arnobius (aab terra
est aiter, Trophonius qai esre jactatur, see App.) seems to show that the
words must be thus taken. Hermes was called χθόνιος, both as presiding
over the hidden treasures 01 the earth and as the conductor of the dead

Penelopa : 80 Herod. 11 145 ἕκ Πηνελόπης καὶ Ἑρμέω λέγεται γενέσθαι ὕπ’
Ἑλλήνων ὀ Πάν. Serv. ad Geory. 1 16 refers to Pindar es the authority for
the legend ; see also on Aea. 1143, and Hemsterhuis on Lucian Diei. Deor.
22. Preller (1 586) suggests that the name Πηνελόπη (from πήνημιηνίζω)
may have had a general sense, like our ‘spinster’.

Aegyptii nefas hahent nominare: so the Romans according to Plu·
tarch (Mor. p. 27811) forbade the name of their tutelsry deity to beuttered;
compare the feeling of the Hebrews about the ineffable Name. I am not
aware of any other Greek or Roman authority who makes two Egyptian
gods answering to the Greek Hermes ; but Thoth was worshipped in
Hermopolis under the two forms 01 the Ibis and the Ape ; and Lenormant
in his Aac. Hist. of the Euat vol. 1 p. 315 tr. distinguishes between the first
Thoth, who ‘was the celestial Hermes, or the personification of the divine
intelligeres ', and ‘the second Hermes, who was only an imitation of the
first, and passed for the author 01 all the socia] institutions of Egypt '.
Ampelius and Servius, following in the main the same tradition as Oia,
make one god out of hisdth and 5th. As far as Ι knoW, it is never stated
that Theuth was regarded as an ineffable name. Herodotus however
often makes a mystery of the name Osiris (eg. 1186, 132, 170), and pro·
fesses his unwillingness to utter the sacred legende, where it was not
absolutely necessary.
