every animal is a compound ol body and soul; body is discerptible and
therefore perinhable ; soul is sensitive and therefore liable to suffering and
death; therefore on both grounds every animal is mortal'; in Gr. some·
thing like this: πᾶν ζῷον σωματικόν τέ ἐστικαὶ ψυχικόν, τὸ δὲ σωματικὸν
διαλυτόν, τὸ δά ψυχικὸν παθητόν, παθητικὸν άρο καὶ διαλυτὸν τὸ ζῷον, τὸ δὲ
τοιοῦτον πᾶν θνητόν. The reasons why I arn disposed to join the two argu-
ments are (l) that the conclusion at the end of the section evidently has
reference to both, end (2) that the twofold nature of the argument serves
to explain the verbiage and repetition which mark thewhole paragraph.
I think however that in any case we must transfer the sentence erqo
deifera-aeternum and place it before camqrw omae animal. We thus bring
together connected clauses and get some reason for the logical particles:
ergo draws the special conclusion from the discerptibility of body to the
discerptibility of the animal, in the earne manner (deifera) as the more
general conclusion of the mortality of the animal was inferred from the
perishableness of the body. Again, 01ᾳοὶ will introduce the minor premiss
after the major ai omae animal talc eet, thus: ‘if all animala are sensitiva,
there is none which is not liable to be affected from without, and if every
animal is of this nature, none is saie from death ; but every animal (is of
this nature, ie.) is framed so as 10 be exposed to the action of external
forces3 therefore everyanimal is liable to death and discerptible'.
patibilem: here with an active force ‘capable of suffering ¹, as in Lact.
11 apattoile elementum, like praestabilis above § 26, insatiabile} 11 98. In
the only other passage in which itia used by Cic. it has a passive force,
Τιιιο. 1v 51 patibiles dolorea=lolerabilee ,· so impetibilis, Fan. 11 57. Com-
pare Arist. Arnim. 11 11 § 11 τὸ αἰσθάνεσθαι πάσχειν τι ε’στίν, ib. 11 5 ἡ
αἴσθησις ἐν τῷ κινεῖσθαί τε καὶ πάσχειν συμβοίνει...δοκεῖ γάρ άλλοίωσίι τις
εἶναι. But Ar. guarda against the inference that what is capable of feeling
is necessarily perishable‚ ib. 115 ξ 5 τὸ πάσχειν τὸ μέν φθορά τις ὑπὸ τοῦ
ἐναντίου, τὸ δὲ σωτηρία μᾶλλον τοῦ δυνάμει ὄντος ὑπὸ τοῦ ἐντελεχείᾳ ὄντος,

accipiendi ahquid extrinsecus: but the Stoica expressly denied that ·
thero was anything outside which could affect their mundane deity, cf. 11 ’
31, 35 nn. Plato’s doctrine of sensation is thus summed up in Plac. Pla.
1v 8 (Diels p. 394): Pl. defines αἴσθησις to be ψυχῆς καὶ σώματος κοινωνίαν
