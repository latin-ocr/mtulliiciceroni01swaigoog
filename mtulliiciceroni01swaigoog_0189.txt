nihil esee animal extrinsecus: sothe uss, bnt edd read terinaeus,
aad Ba also animale. The latter is perhaps right, as we should have ex-
pected arellam rather than altri with animal. There is however no objec-

oeae animal eat, As to eotrimeoae, I understand this to mean aetra capara
homonum and to be equivalent to the words which follow (ia natura atque
muodo), opposed, like the ι’ριιιι nulla se oleo admbeeme natura below,

above, between the fire which gives energy to living creaturas and the lire
ia omrai notura. Compare Fa. v 68 boae qaae aaut extumere, id eat, quae
