the guilty’. His answer (limited by his 0110100 01 the analogica] argument)
is that it is at 011 events in aecordanee with the order 01 nature ; 1110
innocent suffer both'voluntarlly and involuntarily for the sins 01 the
guilty. It is in 10010 consequence of the solidarity 01 mankind : the good
or the evil done by one spreads through all; and the more so, the more
the one stands forward 00 representing the raes or the eommunity, peceaat
reyes, plectantur Achivi. In its human aspect an act 01 atoning 0011-
sacrifioe is the highest and most inspiring manifestation 01 generosity and
nobleness, the magnet which drawa all men upwerds ; in its divine aspect
it is God’s acceptanoe end forgiveness of 011, as sharing in the goodness 01

the attainment of his highest ideal, the consolousness 01 the favour 01 God
and the gratitude 01 men. But all this 01 course implies more than the
mere apae 00000001 01 sacrifice ; 11 implies the spirit 01 00011100, 1101 only
in him who devotes himself, but in all who are to share in the benefits 01
the sacrifice.
