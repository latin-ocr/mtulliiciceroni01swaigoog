in the all-pervading spirit of the universe, but so waere with plants
and stones, yet no one has ever imagined that there could be any tie
of justice between us and them ἓξ lav-1303 the reason why there ia
justice between men and gods is because both participate in reason ξ 131.
Again, there can be no divination if there are no gods, since it is thescience
of signs given by the gods to man ξ 132 (N. D. 11 12).

Sextus, having discussed objections as they occurred, has not reserved
a separate section for their refutation (d), but goes on, after another
insignificant verbal quibble by Zeno, to state the negative argument in
ξ 137. It is from this point that the comparison with N. D. 111 becomes
important. If there are gods, they are animala, since animal nature is
superior to all other nature; but ι1111111111 111 defined by the property 11
sensation, and the gods, as the most perfect 1111111111, will experienee the
greatest variety 11 sensatione (as Carneades says); they will therefore
have sensatione 11 taste, such 11 bitter and suaet, pleasant and unpleasant;
but an unpleasant sensation implies possibility 11 change for the worse,
1.1. implies mortality, and mortal gods are no gods §§ 137-141 (cited
as from Carneades in N. D. 111 31). So, in regard to every sense, animals
are liable to be affected in a manner which 11 either according to their
nature or contrary to their nature ; but that which is contrary to nature
is destructive to life, therefore again all 1111111111 are mortal. This shown
in regard to eye-sight in particular §§ 142-145 (N. D. 11133). Every
sensatior is au alteration3 a deity who undergoes alteration is liable to
change, therefore to death §§ 146, 147. The deity must be either finite 11·
infinite; if infinite, it would be 11111111 and motionless, for motion must
be from place to place, which is impossible 11111111 which fills all space3
again 11 held together by soul, this must be by means of centripetal
and centrifugal movements‚ but the infinite has no centre 11 148, 149
(N. D. 1111511). Nor on the other hand can the deity be finite, for the
finite is contained in the infinite, as the part within the whole, so that
there would be something greater and better than the deity ξ 150. The
deity is either bodied or bodiless3 if the latter, it can neither feel nor
act; 1111111111111,1111111111111111111111111ξ 151. 11 there be a God,
he must have all happiness and all virtue, but he is without ἐγκράτεια and
καρτερία, 111 there is nothing which he finds it hard to bear or to abstain
from ἕξ lea-155 (N. D. 111 38). Further‚ if he has not got these
virtues, he must have the opposite vices, since there is nothing in-
termediate § 156. If there were anything hard for him to bear, it
is evident that he would be liable to distress and therefore to destruction
ξ 157. In like manner heis devoid 11 fortitude, which is defined as the
knowledge of what is, aud what is not, dangerous. For if there is some-
thing dangerous to him, he is liable to destruction ἕξ 158-160 (N. D.
11138). Similarly for magnanimity‚ which consists in rising above the
accidente of life, 111, 11 he is exposed 11 such accidente, he is liable to
destruction ξ 161. So for 1111111111, the knowledge of good and evil and
