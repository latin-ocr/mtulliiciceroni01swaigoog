muna procrea: Hes Theop. 196. No independent authority speaks ἒ
ci Mer-cury as father of Cupid.

Jove ot Diona: Homer Il, v 312, 370.

Anteros: ie. ‘the response of love', also ‘rivalry in love'; whence
he is here and by Lydus made theson of Mars. Pausanias (130)men-
tions an altar to him at Athens, and at Elis (VI 23).

syria Cyproque concepta: this agrees with Lydus τετάρτην τῆς
Συρίας rot Κύπρου, and Ampelius Cypri et Syr-iae filio, but it is a very
shange expression. Conceptus is never used with the simpleAblative (like
praetem above), nor of both parents; and moreover Syrio and Cyprus are
both feminine. If it were not for the parallel passages 1 should be dispcsed ¹
to read a Syria Cyproque accepta ‘borrowed from Syria and Cyprus ', cf.
Herod 1 105 ‘The temple of Uranian Aphrodite at Ascalrm is the most
ancient of all the temples to this goddess; for the Cyprian temple, as the
Cypriam themselves admit, was built in imitation oi it; and that in
Cythera was erected by the Phoenicians, who belong to this part of Syria';
Hos. Theop. 199 Κυπρογενέα d’, ὅτι γέντο πολυκλύστῳ ἐνὶ Κύπρῳ. If the
reading is right, it may have originated in a misunderstanding of the
epither Κυπρογένεια, just as Κορνφογενὴς may have suggested a Coryphe ³
as mother of Minerva ·

Apollinis matrem: see above § 55. Ampelius and Firmicus 16 make
Minerva daughter of Vulcan, perhaps from a misunderstanding of Plato
rim. 23 cn the part of some earlier writer.

orba Nilo: cf. Plato Tim. 21 Ι) (of Sais) θεὸς α’ρχηγόν τίς ἔστιν, Αἶ-
γνπιστὶ μὲν τοῦνομα Nato, Ἑλληνιστὶ δέ, c‘r ὁ ἐκείνων λόγος, Ἀθηνᾶ, Herod. ΙΙ
62 with Wilkinson's n, Plut. Ia θεόν. 32, ib. 9, where she is identified with
Isis and the famous inscriptionis given, ἐγώ εἰμι πᾶν τὸ γεγονὸς καὶ ὃν καὶ
ἐσόμενον, καὶ τὸν ἐμὸν πέπλον οὐδείς πο θνητὸς ἀπεκάλυψεν. Ν 0 independent
authority makes her daughter of Nilus Madv, followed by Mr Reid
(Ama. 1 3 on the words α Socrate ortam), maintains that Cic. never uses
the simple ablativa aiter orror ,· the latter would therefore insert a before
Nelo, if Nidus stands ior the god (as undoubtedly it does), and not the
river. As we have amaa and procreatorem (if the text is right) even
conceptue used with the Abi. in this book, there seems no reason why Cic.
should have objected to the same construction with στεπη and in point of

fact we find it in Plan 118 quibua ortas ais, corr quibuscum vivas conn-

dmdlovo: soe above ξ 53. Arnobius‚ Firmicus and Clam. Al make her

daughter of Satmn and say that she first used armour.

Coryphe: cf. Harpocration s. v. Ἱππία Ἀθηνᾶ, ‘Mnaseas says that the
equestrian Athena was daughter of Poseidon and Coryphe, the daughter of
Oceanus, and that she was the inventress of chariots’. She was wor-.
shipped as Ἱππία at Colonos Virgil attributes the invention to her son,
primm marram marrus at quattuor ausus jungere equosfflco. 111113).
Clemens (in App.) says the Messenians called her Coryphasia α’πὸ τῆς μη-
