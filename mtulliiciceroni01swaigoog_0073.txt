of things indifferent, among which things trouble is included But the
knowledge of trouble can only be gained by experience of trouble itself,
not, as some say, from the experience of pleasure by imagination of the
opposite. For pleasure, being only the removal of pain, ia unknown ιο one
who is ignorant of pain; not ιο mention that being itself (as the Stoice
say) a kind of dissolution it implica mortality ξ) rea—166 (N. D. 11138).

So for εὐβουλία, since all deliberationis of the uncertain, and if there are
things uncertain to the deity, why may it not be uncertain to him whether
the infinite may not conceal‘scme power capable of destroying hirnf Such
uncertainty would naturally give riae ιο fear, which implies mortality
ἕξ 167-170. On the other hand, if nothing ia uncertain to him, he must
know everything by instinct without art3 therefore he must be without
the art of life, which is virtue, and being without virtue he must have
its opposite, vice ἕξ 171-173. Aa to temperance (σωφροσύνη), this
cannot exist without prudence (φρόνησις), as is shown by its name, and it
has been proved that this virtue is inconsistent with deity. Again, tempe·
rauce involves the existence of appetites to be resisted, which is contrary
to our idea of deity ξ) 174, 175 (N. D. 11138). If God is without virtue
he is miserable, if he has virtue there is something superior to him (the
perfectiora or virtue of a thing being superior ιο ιιο thing itself); if neither
of these contradictories is true, ιο must be non-existent ξι 176, 177.
Once more, God has either the faculty of speech or he has not ; the latter
is absmd and contrary ιο universal belief ; but if he has speech, he must
also possess all those parts of the body which conduoe to speech, which is
an idea only worthy of the Epicureans; he must also speak in some
particular dialect, and if so how will he express himself to those who
use another tonguel Therefore‚ as before, he must be non-existent ἕξ 178,
179. So,if (lod has a body, it must be either simple or compound: the
compound is liable ιο dissolution, the simple is inanimate and irrational

We have also on this point the following sorites of Carneades preserved
by Clitomachus. If Zeus is a god, so is his brother Poseidon; if Poseidon,
then Achelous and Nilus, and every river and torrent. But these are not
gods, therefore neither is Zeus ᾧ) 182, 183 (N. D. 111 43, 44). If the sun is
a god, so is the day (which is only a name for the sun above the horizon) ;
if the day, then the month, ιιο year, the morning and eveuing ξ 184
(N. D. 111 51). If Artemis, so is Enodia, &c.; if Aphrodite, so Eros
and other feelings of the mind, such as Pity and Fear ξ) 185-188
(cf. N. D. 111 47). If Demeter (= γῆ μήτηρ), then the earth, ιιο hills, the
promontories, every stoue ξ 189 (N. D. 111 59). Carneades adds many
other examples, but the above will suffice ιο show the nature of the
arguments 190.
’ Such being the variety of opinions among philosophers as to the divine
existence, and such the grounds assigned on¹ either side, the Sceptics have
preferred ιο suspend their judgment, and they have felt themselves con·
