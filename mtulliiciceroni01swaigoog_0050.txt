RELATIONSHIP OF MSS.

This agrees fairly with Forohhammer’s view (Ncrdisle Tidslcrifl

for 1880, p. 23 foll), except that he does not recognire any connexion
between E and the lst line of descent (β), whereas many inswnees
will be found above in which E agrees with A and 0 against B.

I think also he is wrong in speaking of the group (γ) as asama‘lio
deterior. Almost all the inferior codices may Ι think be affiliated

to P. Again, where B alone has the true reading, Forehhammer will
not allow that this is due to its being itself copied from the arche·

· type οι· even to its belonging to a better tradition: in all such

cases he holds that the true reading is an emendation. Ι do not
think any one who has taken the trouble to look through the
readings given above will accept this view of B. On the other hand
Ι cannot agree with Muller (Neue Jatrtoalar 1864 pp. lat-147,
261-281, 605-631) and Vahlen (in the introduction to his edition
of the De Legibus) in ranking B higher than A*. It is undoubtedly
less trustworthy, and though it is more osten the sole represen-
tative of the archetype, this may be only because, A being closely
allied with OPV, where A is right, these are usually right with it
It may be worth while to add that the texts used by Priscian

and Probus seem to heve been in some respeets better than our
archetype, cf. 11 117, neander for Prob. 106, for Priscian.
