fructusque inediis postremum satorem immflcitur, herein differing from the

feeling cf the contemporaries of Dionysius, when he says, in reference to
the denunciatione of impending wrath uttered by Phyton, the breve oom-
mander of the Rhagiane, ‘the prophetie persuasion under which this

i unhappy man perished, that divine vengeance would soon overtake his

destmyer, was no wey borne out by the subsequent reulity’.

in tyrannidis rogum: as regards the cause of his death, the account
of J nstin lc. is confirmed by the statement in Nepos (Dion 2) that poison
was given to him in his last illness hy his physieians at the instance of
his son, in order to prevent Dion's speaking to him about the division of
the kingdom ; and by Plutarch (Dion 6), who cites Timaeus as his autho·
rity, and only differs from Nepos in imputing the action entirely to the
physicum, who thought thus to seeum the favour of the younger D.
This is not inconsistent with the repert of Diodorus (xv 4) that the illness
of the elder Dionysius was itself caused by excessivo feasting in his delight
at the success of his tragedy (Λύτρα Ἕκτορος) at Athens; cf. Plin. vn 53,
who makes him die simply of excitement ou hearing the good news The

meinland‚ this disposes of all emendations referring to Temenitis, which
was at some distance from Ortygia) Theo (Progenie. 8 in Welz libet. Gr. 1
