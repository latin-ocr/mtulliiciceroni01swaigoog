aas uss. n a cury by a amparem wita ue psius passage aas re Ὗ
that we learn patrimonia spe aaa tradendi relinquimus, quo pommus ¹
salli ; deur falli qui polest! This oi course explains why there can be no
comparison between the divine gis and the human legacy‚ hut the essen·
tinl point, that God cannot err, is uot mentioned in the emher passage.
Il we transfer the sentences rien erim et patrimonium-solmam lrom
§71 and place them alter sinderedo, we remove them from a context in
which they are unmeaning, and we get e natural explanation for the
question quae eal ire collatione ieta rimdrtudo. Again the sentences be-
ginning quae maim libido, and injustitiae aetem seem to me to have no

connexion with those which precede them according to the us order ; but, Ἰ
if we put injustitiae-nebunt alter amice dedit, and then go on with quae ³
enim libide-o nobb, everything falls into its proper place. Isstly it ¹

seems to me lar more natural that the general statement multi enim-—
obscurum should precede the particular exemplos nec enim Heracli-
potueram, than the reverse. The only difficulty which wil] then remain
is the omission of the statement contained in ξ 76 that ‘God cannot make
mistakes as men do', which ought to have followed noem columem but
this omission is easily explicable‚ if I am right in my general view ol the
dislocation which the passage hes uudergone. It remeius to account lor
the repetitions above noticed in the general argument3 and this seems to
me most easily done, if we suppose Cicero to have written, first of all, the
ahorter summary contained in §§ 69-71, aud then to have expandcd it in
chapters xx1x to xxxn Medea modo—mnu aare murt (ἑξ 71-79); and

that both were inserted in the text hythe mistake of the original editor. ³

, Or is it possible that Carneades met the Stoic proof ol Divina benevolence ³

shown in the gift ol reason, by a twofold argument, one that which Cicero
gives fully in the lud passage and briefly and confusedly in the lst, vin
our experienoe of the mischisl arising from the use of reason, which an
infinitely wisc Being must have foreseen3 and the other, that we cannot
judgeolthe intentiones an agent from the result of his action, because
experience shows that wall-intended actions are osten harmful and ill-
intended benefidall If we are to take this view, Cicero has entirely
sailed to distinguish between the two arguments, and has also destroyed
the force of tha latter by introducing his quae ert audendo, our humen
experienee being the only ground on which such an argument could bs
based.

Oh. xxv111. bule loco sic soletis occanere: ‘you are mcusmmed
to meet· (ἀπαντᾶν) this line of argument as follows '. Lem is not merely

‘topic ’‚ but an argument capable of general application. Tharais no
reference here to anything in the speech of Balbus For the subject
matter sec below ξ 76.

non inchoo-urerentur: ‘man's ahuse ol the Divina favour is no proof
that heaven hes not made the best provision for us'. Tha verb is attracted
to the tense of the Infinitive ς see 1 8 n. on profecisse.
