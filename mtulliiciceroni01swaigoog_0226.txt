to Iberes: beside the sacred bulls Apis, Mnevis, dac, the cow was sacred
s1s.

eques: the horse was not sacred in Egypt, but perhaps the reference in
the original was ιο the hippopotamus (eques flecteretur), which was the
emblem of Typhon, see Herod. 11 71. Ι see no objection ιο the et which
couples the domestic animals, end so contrasts them with the following

wild animais·

accipitres: sacred ιο Ra, the god of the Sum

aspidas: sacred ιο Neph (Plut. Ista 74).

pisces: Wilkinson mentions five different kinds of fishes which were
sacred ιο different gods, cf. Plut. l.c. 72, Mayor on J uv. xv 7, Obbar on
Hor. Ep. 12, 2-24.

canes: sacred ιο Anubis, cf. Juv. xv 8 n. Hence Socrates used ιο
swear νὴ τὸν κύνα τὸν τῶν Αἰγυπτίων θεόν, see Plut. Isis 44.

lupos: an object of worship in Lycopolis, Plut. Isis 72.

multas praeterea beluas: eg. the lion, the ass, the ram, the ape, the
ichneumon, the shrewmouse, the scarabeus.

in numerum reponemus: for constr, see 11 54.

quae si rejicimus—rejiciemuse so Ι venture to read irstead of ai
re‘iciamea of uss. The Indic. is the mood employed throughout the
whole passage, thus we have above aisaet'mee...cer repudient& and indeed
the subjunctive, which implies that the supposed ease is contrary to fact
(Rcby 11 pp. xcix, c), would be quite out of place here: Cotta assumes
that we do reject these bestial gods, and argues from this fact ιο the
rejection of all foreign gods, including those which have been to a certain
extent naturalized, such as Isis. It makes uonsense ιο say ‘if we were ιο
reject them, we shall reject the others '.

j 48. Ino: see above j 39.

Pasiphae: she is really a lunar goddess (as the name denotes), and was
worshipped under the form of a white cow. Oracles were given in dreams
at her temple in Sparta (Die. 1 96). Itis true the genealogy of the Spartan
goddess differs from that of the Cretan, see above j 521.

et Aeeta e Perseide, Oceani fllia, nati: so Sch. optas. 111 347 foll.
correcte the us reading et eae e Perside Oceani filiae actae. When the
name Aeeta had got corrupted, the gender of acti would naturally be
altered (Madv. however, on Five. 11 94, denies that the form Aeeta ls used
by Cic. in the Nom.) Aeetes is again referred ιο just below and in j 54;
otherwise Ι should have preferred to read Aeaea, as nearer ιο the ue, un-
derstanding by it Calypso, who is called Aeaea petella by Prop. 1v ll. 31,
end was also a sister of Circe according to Tzetzes on Lycophr. 174, 798,
ἀδελφοὶ δὲ Alvjrov καὶ Ἀλωέως, ἦτοι Ἡλίου θυγατέρες Κίρκη καὶ ⁸IIeoedfvy,
καθ’ ἑτέρους δὲ aral Καλυψώ.

circen quoque Circeienses colunt: cf. Hom. Od.x1³5 Αἰαίην e’ ἐς
