(N. D. 11 18). It is objected that we might similarly argue ‘man hes bile, ¹
therefore the universe must be bilious’, bnt the argument applies only .

to pure clemente, not to secondary compounds such 08 bile. Putting it
in another way we might say ‘if there were nothing earthy in the

universe, there could have been nothing earthy in man; so, if there were ¹

nothing rational in the universe, there could have been no reason in man’

sculptor, shall we not do the same when we think of the mind 01 man,

which is so far more marvellous than any statnel §§ 99,100 (Ν. D. 11 87).

Argument of Zeno: that from which the seeds of reason proceed must ,

itself be rational, 101 811 subordinate faculties testify to the character of the
ἡγεμονικόν frum which they are derived; since then the universe contains
the seeds of all rational creaturus, the ἡγεμονικόν 01 the univerae must

be rational, and therefore divine (ξ 101-103 (Ν. D. 1122, 29, 30). Argu-

ment of Zeno after Plato: since that which is ammata end rational is ’

superior to that which is inanimate and irrational, the universe, being
supreme, must be a rational animal The objection of Alexinus, that on
the same ground the universe might be proved to be a poet and gramma-
rian, confounds the absolute end the relative best; Archilochus was a
poet, buthe wes not therefore superior to Socrates who was no poet
ξ( 104-110 (Ν. D. 11 18, 21). The Stoice prove the divinity 01 the world
frum its motion, which must proceed from nature or volition or necessity.
It is certainly not the last, in the sense 01 an irrational vortex, such aa
Democritus held, for it is‘orderly, unchcnging end harmonicus. It is not

caused by an unconscious nature, since this would be inferior to the ¹

rational netures included iu the universe. It must therefore be camed by a
rational nature. Further, voluntnry movements are always more admirable
then those which are involuntary. When we admire the sphere 01
Archimedes, it 18 not the moving frame we wonder at, but the rational
volition of the astronomer. rigam, the more wonderful the thing moved,
by so much more wonderful is the moving force. Hence the force which
moves the entim universe is thc most admirable 01 all things, and being
such it must be a rational and voluntary agent, ie. (1οἀ ξ) Ill—118

piety‚ which is defined as ἐπιστήμη θεαῖν θεραπείας, forthere can be no
science of the non-existent§ 123; nor as holiness, for this is defined aa
δικαιοσύνη πρὸς θεούς ξ 124 (Ν. D. 1 3, 4,11 153); nor aa wisdom, defined

from the fellowship existing between men and God ξ 126 (N. D. 14).
Pythagoras and others erroneously extended this fellowship to >irrational
creaturos, with which it is true we are connected by common perticipation
