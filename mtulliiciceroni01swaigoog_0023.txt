The and portion of Bk 1 contains the Epicurean polemio against
the orthodox theology, Platonie and Stoic. It touches on many
interesting points, but it does no mora than touch on them3 its
criticism is addressed as usual to the gallery‚ very much in the style
of tha altercatio with Clodius, oi which Cicero writes with such
complacenoy to Atticus (dtt. 1 3), and ior the most part consiste of
a series ol exclamatory questions, which are assumed to be unanswer-
able, though the answer may be distinetly given in the words of the
treatise criticiaed¹. The more rational objections, such as those which
turn on the possibility of Orestion at a particular moment oi time,

met by succeeding speakers No one seems to pay any attention to
them. Just aa it is afterwards with the Academic criticisms on the
Epicurean and Staio systema, there is no right oi reply, no judicial
weighing of opposing arguments, no honest endeavour to carry out
even the principle of Carneades and ascertain precisely to which side
the balance of probability inclines.

The review of the history of religious opinions contained in the
following sections (ἓξ 25-43) is, as I have already remarked‚ the great

regards the prae-Stolo philosophy, it does not contain a single strictly
accurate statement ora single intelligent criticism. It may be said,
this is the fault not of Oicero but oi the Epicurean authority whom
he sollows 3 Cicero merely gives it as a specimen oi Epicurean
ignorance and prejudice. But ii it was intended aa an exposure
oi this sort, why is it that, so sariram giving any hint to that
effect, so sariram correcting any oi the blunders of Velleius, cicero

unconscious of the inaccuiacies which 611 the historieal section, and

comparison with the fragments of Philodemus) arose from hia own s
