the reference to Punic scothsayers, Dic. 1128, with which may be
compared the references to Carthago in our beatiss 111 42, 91.
May we then assume that the whole of our treatise is taken from

Clitomachus't Schwencke notices a differente in the mode of referring
to the Stoic doctrines, which he would use as a clue to distinguish

between what is taken without alteration from Clitomachus and what
is added or modified by Cicero. 1ηὲ 6-28 we have the Imperfects
dicebas, conememorabar, emebatur, with evident reference to the
former book 3 in ἓξ 29-38 we have debitis, albae soleria cobis uidetur,
pkccet, referring to the doctrines of the Stoica generally. But I
think we can only gathcr from this, that Cicero began his 3rd book
with the idea of meeting the Posidonian argument of the and book
with detailed criticism horrowed from Clitomachus and supplemented
by himself 3 that, on finding this to be irksome or impracticable‚
inasmuch as the work of Clitomachus was written in reference to the
elder Stoicism and was not adopted to the exposition of Stoical
doctrine subsequently put forward by Posidonius, he in §S 17 and 18
abandons the intention announced in ἓξ 6, 7, 10, of following the
exact order of the previous book, and pmposes tc defer the chief
part of the discussion on the divine existence to the aection on Pro
vidence. As he thus breaks loose from the order of the second book,
adopting instead the independent arrangement of his authority, it
is natural that he should gradually discontinue the Imperfectof refer-
ence, especially where the argument borrowed from Clitomachus is
altogether irrespective of anything urged by Posidonius, eg. in
§gre-34, 70 foll. Towards the end of the book the tud person plural
of the presentis used indifferently, whether the argument discussed
had or had not been employed by Posidonius, see notes on sic euim
dicitis ἓ 86, and ltaec cecant ἓ 93. At times the Academic criticism
is obscure as being directed against arguments or illustrations which
do not appear in the second book, cinctas on Hipponax and Cri-
tclaus ἕ 91 ; at times doctrines are attributed to the Stoics which are
iu flat contradiction with the doctrine put forward in that book, cf.
593.

Turning now to the earlier part of the book, there can be little
doubt thatffi 1-13 with their light bantering tone and illustra·
tions from Roman history are purely Ciceronian. The argument
against divination in ἓ 14 we have seen to be probably taken from
Carneades, and the illustration from medicine and the use of the
word στρατήγημα suggest a Greek original for the following para·
