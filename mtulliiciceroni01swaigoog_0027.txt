much that is placed under the 3rd would bave come better under the

mences his 4th division 001 01 110 proper order in 5 133, giving a 00

Itis more difficult 10 take a general view 01 110 3rd book than
01 110 preceding, as 00 large a portion, probably more than one
third, has beenlost. It will 10 seen from the analysis, 00 well 00
from the Essay which follows, upon the Sources 01 1110 book, that 110
arrangement 01 what remains 10 again unsatisfactory. Cicero is
embarrassed throughout by having 10 mesta 10100 81010 argument
001 0100 earlier Academic treatise, iu which 110 100100 are different
aud differently arranged. This explains why, after Ootta has an-
nounced his intention to treet several of the arguments adduced for
the Divina existenceunder 110 3rd head, instead 01 under the 101,
as Balbus had done (111 17, 18), 10 introduces them under the 2οἀ
head without giving any reason for his change 01 purpose. We
will take the different arguments in order with reference 10 110
correspondiug parts 01 110 and book. There is certainly some weight
in the objections urged to the argument from universal 0000001, viz.
that the object 01 popular belief is not the God 01 the 810100, and
that itis inconsistent iu those who regard the majority as 10010, 10
011001 any importauce to what the majority believe (ἓξ 10, 11) ; still
these objections hardly apply to the arguments as stated 10 Bk 11.
Ooaseusus 10 cited there as a proof not 01 any special 81010 doctrine,
but 01 110 existence 01 0 Divina Goveruor3 and a careful distinction ¹
is made between temporary opinion and fixed belief, especially
where the latter becomes stronger with the advance iu civilization.
The 81010 arguments derived from recorded epiphanies and the prac-
110001 divination, are fairly met by denial 01 110 10010 and questioning
