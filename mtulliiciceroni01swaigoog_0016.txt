subject of religion⁸. A few had been driven into atheism by the
recoil from superstition 3 but religious belief was natural to man,
and the real question at issue among thinking men generally was the

they were compelled to acknowledge. The Epicureans boasted loudly
of what they had done to set men free from the letters of superstition,
but so lar as they had succeeded in doing this, it was only by aban-
