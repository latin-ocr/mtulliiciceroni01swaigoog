arising apparently from over-haste in translating the original, see
notes 011 faurum Proserpinae 5 83, ud Peloponnesum ih, Epidauri ib.,
uwnsus arguturus 5 84, ue Delio quidem Apollini 5 88. As 10 the
manner in which these objections were met by the Stoice see my
notes on each passage. In some instances they may be directly
answered from the speech 01 Balbus, e. g., the assumption that virtue
is allowed by all 10 be independent of Divina grace, is contradictcd
in 11 79 ; the asserticn that, according 10 the Stoice, Providence does
not extend to individuals, is contradioted in 11 165. In both these
cases it is probable 11111 the elder Stoice held the doctrines impugned,
but this want of correspondente between the exposition and the
criticism spoils the verisimilitude 01 the dialogus.

Aeto Cicero's own feeling with regard to the questions at issue,
we find him dissenting from the Academic view in regaul to the
misfoitunes of the good and the prosperity 01 the had, in the passages
cited in my notes on 5 80 Reguli, 5 84 permistim on conscience as the
voice of (sod 5 85 siue 0110 diuina 1011111103 on virtue ae the gift 01

partisaus could pretend that the Academia difficulties were entirely
cleared up by such consideratione as were available cn the other side.
Then, as now, the Divina government was 1 matter cf faith, not 01
certainty. Now, as then, in spite of the added light 01 Christianity,
we must confess that, logically speaking, the religione view 011110
order 01 the world is only the more probahle; that Oicero in fact is
sight, 11 against the 810101, when hc refuses tc say mors than that the
argument 01 Balbus appeared 10 him 10 be ud mritatis similitudimem
properator.

Lastly, provokingly inconsistent as is the Academia view which
at one time professes 10 be guided by reason alone, irrespective 01
authority (1 10), and at other times, in the person cf Cotta, accepts
without inquiry whatever 1111 come down to us cn the authority 01
ourancestors(1115, 9); which sneers at the sacred legends and the
practice of divination, and does its best to show that the very idea 01
God is selfcontradictory and impossible, and yet iusists on retaining
all the 0111011111 01 religion as a duty obligatory cn every Roman
citizen 3 still the Academic pontiti is a person 01 genuine historica]
interest. He is the Trajan who, allowing that there is no harm in
Christianity and that Ohristians 110 not to be hunted out, yet ordains
that if a man is accused 01 Christianity before a magistrate and
refuses to abjure his faith, he is to be put 10 death. In later times
