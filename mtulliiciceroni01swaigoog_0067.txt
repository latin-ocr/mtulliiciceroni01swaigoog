ON THE SOURCES OE THE THIRD BOOK OF THE
DE NATURA DEORUM.

There cen be no doubt thot for the materiale of this book Cicero
was mainly indebted to the Corthsgmnieu Hasdrubal, better known
hy his Greek name Clitomachus, who was horn about 180 nc. and
went to reside at Athens about 155. He was ior many years α
disciple oi Carneades snd eventunlly become the head of the Now Ἴ
Academy. Carneades himself hoving leit no written remeins (Diog-
ιν 65, Plut. Mor. p. 328), it wos through the voluminous writings of
his scholar, extending to more than luo volumes, that his teaching

was perpetuated, cf. Diog. lv 67 διεδέξατο τὸν Καρνεάδην καὶ rd l

two oi his philosophicel trectises to Romans, one to the satirist τ

Lucilius, the other to Censorinus, consul in 149 nc.; end that he
wss lecturing at Athens during the quaestorship of the orator Crassus
110 nc. (Orat. 1 45). Cicero mentions a trectise περὶ ἐποχῆς in

four books (Ac. 11 98) end e consolatio written to his countrymen
after the fall of Carthago (Taso. 111 54). Schwencke (Jaarb. fi

class. Plcilol. 1879, 2 p. 141) conjectures that the title of the treatise
employed hore by Cicero was περὶ προνοίας. ,
