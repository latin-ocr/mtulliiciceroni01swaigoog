cate that these quasi-auxiliary verbs were felt to take the place of the
Subjunotive mood; in other words that the force of the Subj. was felt
to be expressed by these auxiliariesl see Boetticher's Leo. Tac. p. 106
(on the pregnaut force of the conjunctive) aud Nagelsb. p. 267. Lastly,
is it true that this Jussive force is confiued ιο conditional or quasi-con-
ditional sentences, as asserted by Mr Reid and nn Nixon aud apparently
by Madv. rte 11 35 (where he speaks of it as a particular use of the
conjunctive qoodpoet coredioiomm, aior ea verbis expressa ert sice imeaeyt

connecting this use with the Deliberative and Optative uses, there seems
no a probri reason for limiting it to the conditional sentence, and certainly
there is nothing ιο suggest it o posteriori It would at any rate require
a remarkable power of special pleading to explain as conditional sentences
all the axx. cited above. Even, if we should allow that the Jussive origi·

closely connected with the other recognized uses of the Subj„ all springing γ

from the root conception of the mood as expressive of thought in contrast to
soot; and in any cese this particular use has outgrown its origin and estab
lished its right to be treated as an independent off-shoot of the root, just
as much as the Imperativa‚ Deliberative and Optative uses I will only
add that two other exn of this use are generally cited from the N. D.‚ samp-

them as such myselt because Ι thought them capable of another explana-

probably have understood them with what we know as s ‘jussive' force.
[I think those who object to the so-called jussive use of the subjunctive
have sailed to see that the ground of objection is applicable ιο a number of
other ηοω which no one could think of disputing. Faciat, ree faciat,
ne seceris in the usual imperative meaning: saciat, feceret, fecisset in the
concessive uses; nterim, morerer in optative uses; quid opem? quiet

agereret in socalled dubitativa uses; the whole class of subjunctives of 2

purpose (as distinguished from subjunctivae of result) including such uses
es mtto ut (or que) societ, porteto faceat, censeo socios, doc, all exhibit'

a jussive meaning (see my Grammar ch. m), and I can see no reason in ζ
objecting ιο treet es such the verbs in At tc dictes, Albane, marteres! or in

Quid riti com pelago? terro contecta sitisses (Ov. Am. 111 8. 49). But ς

neither could Ι assert that here, as elsewhere, there are not more ways
than oue of taking particular expressions. The original subjective force of

the subjunctive mood was gradually specialised in various directions, one j
phrase or class of phrases being developed by analogy to some other. ’
Whether this jussive use was developed from the protasis of a conditional ο

sentence by suppressing the apodosis, or from the apodosis by suppressing
the protasis, is impossible ιο say. It may well have been a collateral to‚'
