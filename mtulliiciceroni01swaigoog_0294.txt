3 narrated by Mnaseas in the 3rd book oi his Europa. Harpocration

cites Mnaseas for the statement that Minerva, daughter oi Coryphe,
daughter of Oceanus, was the inventress of ohariots. Tzetzes and
Firmicus agree in the story of Minerva slaying her father Pallas.
The Orphio hymns illustrate the names Eubuleus, Tritopatreus,
Anactes As Mnaseas is mentioned by three different writers,

, Arnobius, Harpocration and Fulgentius, as the source from whom
k they have borrowed, and as he is a noted Euhemerist of the
' Alexandrian school, the evidence, so far as it goes, seems to point

to him as the mythologist followed by Clitomachus, ie. by Carneades.

As regards Oicero’s summary, it is evidently very incompleta.
He omits from his list the names J uno, Ceres, Neptunus, Mars,
Pluto, Hecate, Pau, Rhea, Proserpina. He sometimes pasees over
the common tradition, as that which makes Dionysus son oi Semele:

³ he omits to note real differeuces, such as that between his three

Cupitis and the primaeval Eros, or between the Greek and the
Ephesian Diana3 aud makes distinctions where there are none, as
in the case of Aesculapius, Mercurius and Minerva The frequent
references to Egypt, the paternity oi Nilus in the oasa of five
deicias, the names Theuth and Phthas aud the ineffable name of

· Mercurius would seem to indicate au Alexandrina origin, while

the references to mystic rites suggest a connexion with the Orphio
theology.

In the comparative view, which follows, square brackets denote
that the statement made is not given in that particular place by
Oioero, but supplied from another part of his summary.
