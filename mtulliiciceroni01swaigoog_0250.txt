lay against one who had aided and counselled, though he had not actually

tutelae: [a ward had a right of action against his guardian to obtain
compensation for any failure in his duty as trustee. This is called in the

Digest 00110 tutelae. But there was another action, 01 0 penal character, -
μ to make the guardian refund twice the velue 01 anything which he had

abstracted from the property 01 the ward. This action was given by the
111 tables (ib. xxv17.155 ξ 1) and was specially called rationibus 1111110-
1000111 00110 (1119. xxvn 3. 12). Whether the two were clearly distin-

* guished in Cicero's time may be doubtful. Both then and afterwards any

guardian condemned in an 00110 tutelae was disgraced and therefore

, deprived of civic rights. Of. 010. Or. 130§ 166 turpi tutelae judicto ,· Gai,

that in the order of matters in J ulian'e edict theft immediately followed
guardianship. R.]

mandati: [by 0100010100 was understood an unpaid commission. A
man undertaking such a commission for another was in the position 01 a ⁴
trustee: he could recover his expensos but had no right to make any
profit or benefit for himself by the execution of the commission. Good

i faith was 01 the essence of the engagement. of. Gai. 111 155 Invicem 01101
