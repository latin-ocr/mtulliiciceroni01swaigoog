RELATIONSHIP OF MSS. XXXV

must either represent the archetype, emended by V' and B, or else
the former are derived from 'the same incorrect copy 01 α.

ἓ 24. fieri non possunt B¹‚ all others nonne. There can be little
doubt that non is what Cicero wrote, but the reading nonne is not so
objectionable as to call for emendation. It would seem therefore
that B here represents the archetype, and that the others are con-
nected with it by a medium which in this instance proves to be less
trustworthy.

§26. Orionem B, orationem AOEPV. Herc in all probability n
had a contractiori wrongly interpreted by all but B*.

527. 01611116 [Β], scientia AOEPV. This is another evidence
showing that B is connected with the archetype by a different line 01
descent from that 01 the others.

542. (Lysithoe 661), 1161110 661 Β (perhaps Lysittocat in 0),
Lyaito est AOPV, 116110 661 Ε.

543. (capedunculis 116), cap. 116 Β, om. 116 AOEPV. The
ι demonstrative seems necessary, but was 01 course easily lost after -lia

547. 1116 Β, 111 AEV¹, 111 Ο, 1166 V2, nothing said 01 P. Here
0 appears to represent a, while AV have neglected to mark the
abbreviated 6 and B has written it out in full.

549. 61611111 11111ΒΕ, 61611111111Α1, 61611111 111 V¹, 6161111111 dit
(1, 6111611111 di P, 61 611111 111111 A', 61 61111111 111111’. Probably α
omitted the demonstrative, as in ἓ 43 61 di 611111, where I have added
1611. 11 Cicero wrote 61111 di 611111, 11 would be easy for 11110 drop
out, and the variety of readings suggests that each scribe reinserted
it, where he thought best.

552. jam B, 111111 OEV, and probably A¹, 111111 Α’, nothing said
of P. Here B either follows aseparate tradition or has emended the
common archetype.

111016 Β, mater AOEPV. An abbreviated 1110101 might

easily be mistakcn formare and v.v. The readings may be most .

easily explained by supposing two recensions 01 0, one followed by
AOPV (β), the other by B (γ).

554. Mnemosyne [BP], nemoaine Ε, nemo 61116 AOV (nemo
‘in ras' A) 1.

5 57. Cynosuris [BP] yynosnrts ΑΘΕ, 9110611116 V¹.

566. 0111111111 ΒΕ, 01111111 AOPV. It seems moreprobable that

⁴* Deiter (nt. Mna. lesa p. 314) states that B has orationem like the rest.
† Deiter gives 1111111οεί111 as B’s reading.
