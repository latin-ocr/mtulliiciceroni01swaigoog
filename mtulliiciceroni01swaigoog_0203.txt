she was sister of Leto wife of Perses and mother of Hecate (see below § 46):

she changed herself into a quail tc escape from the pursuit of Zeus, and

having afterwards thrown herself into the sea was metamorphosed into the
island Ortygia (Delos). Probably the name Asteria was selected by the
mythologers as approaching most nearly 10 Ashteroth and Astarte (see
below ξ 59). Thus Lydus (1v 44) oi δὲ Φοίνικες Ἀστάρτην τὴν σφῶν πολιοῦ-
