11ιο archetype from which all the existing uss are derived must
have been in a very bad condition, having lost considerable portione
01 the 3rd book, and having suffered much from dislocation in the
and book and, as I believe, in the 3rd also. 01 the four sections,
into which the 3rd book is divided‚ the whole 01 O (dealing with the
Stoic argument in proof 01 the Providential Government 01 the
universe) and a considerable portion 01 D (dealing with the argu·
ment in proof of a special Providence ordering the affairs of men)
have been lost3 and smaller losses occur in the same book at the end
01 ἐξ 13 and 64, and in 1 ἓξ 25, 65. The great instance 01 dislocation Ι
10 inthe andbook, where ἕξ 16-86 are placed after 5 156, but in
my note on 111 43 01 jam deceta I have attempted 10 show
that we have there also a transposition in the 000 0160 53-60,
which ought 10 come before 543. For examples 01 what appears to
me dislocation on a smaller scale, see the notes on 1 6 qna qnidam e'n
caasa, 107 an qaisquam—vidimus (which, following Bake, Ι have
transferred 10 the end of 5 88), 11 110 atqne ita ‹limante—appareat,
transferred 1οἓ 104, also 11 167 rnapnis 0001101029 00οι000 omne
animal, ἓ 34 annin, 5 70 0. 00 110 (3). The cause 01 the dislocation
in Bk. 11 was doubtless that the archetype had come 10 pieces and
was bound up again in wrong order, without any regard to sense.
So B (eod. Leid. 86) interposes part 01 the De Divinatione after
N. D. 1 64, giving the following ἓξ (6.4-91) after De Fato ξ 4, 000
0010 00 the latter passage in Orelli's ed., and Bake's ed. of the 110
Lepidae p. 104 1011, where B is thus described “constat quaterni-
onibns mv. qaorarn 0109010 octo folia hahart. Ceteram 0100010100

faciant, oetas 00000010 margine 00610010 solet indicare.'' In Bk. 111
I have suggested that it may have been Oicero's own intention to
omit the mythological section, and that this was afterwards inserted
by the original editor in a wrong place. As to the smaller transposi-
tions they are probably owing to the wrong insertion of marginal notes
or of additions written on slips 01 parchment which got fastencd to the
