¹ 1111111111 Proserpinae: this, the most famous temple 01 the Epizephy-

3 rian Locri, was plundered by Pyrrhus, who was visited with a sturmin

consequence and compelled 10 1011010 the stolen tressure; 01. Liv.xx1x
18, where the 10011011 speaker, complaining 01 the plunder 01 the temple
in the Hannibalian war by Pleminius, the legate, 101011 10 the sacrilege
of Pyrrhus, and says that he was the first who had ever ventured to lay

’ hands on the treasures (10101101 001 eam 0110111). The senate condemned

Ι Pleminius and ordered restitution to be made. Diodorus (xxvrr 4) tells
the same story, adding ἐπιφανέστατον τῶν κατὰ τὴν Ἰταλίαν ἶερῶν τοῦτ’ εἶναι
λέγεται calcitrante ἁγνὸν ὑπὸ τῶν ἐγχωρίων τετηρῆσθαι, cf. Val. Max. Ι 20
ext 1. It would seem therefore that neither Livy nor Diodorus accepted
the story here told by 010, which in fact is hardly credible on other
grounds, as Locri was the native place 01 Doris, the wile of Dionysius, and
was also 01 great use to himin his wara against Rhegium and other states
01 Magna Graecia, services which he repaid by repeatedly enlarging its

, territory 01 the expense 01 his enemies. As we are told 01 the detestation

in which the younger Dionysius was held at Locri, during his residence
there 01101 his first expulsicn from Syracuse in 35610, it might be
supposed that he is the person here referred 10, but the other anecdotos
seem 10 be all spoken 01 the elder Dionysius. Is it possible that Cic, 01
his authority,has written Locri 101 Crotona and Proserpina 101 Junci because

. 110 read that the elder Dionysius plundered the temple 01 Ηο10 Lacynia 01
¹ Crotona, and sold to the Carthaginians for 120 talenta the 00111] robe 01
