no. 408, when the three ancient tribes or states combined for that purpose.
'l'he Rhodion genealogy is thus given by Diod, v 56: ‘Helios and Rhodus
had seven sons, of whom only two, Ochimus and Oercaphus, continued in
the island ι these joined in building the city of Achaia (also mentioned by
Ergias the Rhodion ap. Athenaeus vm p. 360) ; of which Ochimus was the
first ruler. After his death he was sucoeeded by his brother Oercaphus.

common tradition ; which speaks of the island of Rhodes, not as the birth-

Again the name cf Acantho is unknown in connexion with Helios. The
nymph Rhodus or Rhode is usually represented as daughter of Poseidon
and *Amphitrite or Halia, and as the bride, never the mother, oi Halios.
Whatever may have been the original reading, it seems to have been early
changed into something like its present form, as Rhodi appears in the
locative both in Ampelius and Amobius, and the letter makes Acantho
the mother of Sol. See Appendix.
