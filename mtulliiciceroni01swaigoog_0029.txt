that he has reason and that the atara are without it (shirking the
question and also assuming what the 810101 denied) 3 to the 3rd that
the world was not built but formed by nature (what nature forms a's
built, according 10 the 810101 3 but this argument, like the others, is
equally true, put into its most general form: the beauty of the
universe is only very partially explained by the pleasure or utility

which it affords to man). In 5 27 Cotta proceeds with 1110 argument ,

quoted from Xenophon (11 18), ‘whence did man obtain reason 11 11

did not exist in the worldl' to which 110 makes the same frivolous ¹

answer as 110 had done to the similar questions of Zeno. Then comes ζ
(1118 28) an approving reference to the sympathy which anites all the

parts of the universe, but it is denied that this affords any ground for ἶ

believing that the universe is pervaded by a divine spirit or brcath 3

it is all the uncouscioua operation 01 nature. Here again we have ¹

simple assertion on the part 01 the Academica The vagae term
nature was explained by the Epicureans,f1om the analogy of material
objects, to mean atoms moving in a vacuum according to the laws of
gravitation modified by the individnal clinamen, by the 810101, from
the analogy of the soul, to mean the reason and will embodied in
the universe 3 the Academica, clinging to their unanalysed conception
01 nature, opposed their simple (1011101 10 both.

There 11 more weight in the argument by which Carneades cn-
deavoured to show that 11 the world isan animal it must be liable to

destruction and therefore not divine. As corporeal it is discerptible 3 1
' as a compound of contrary and perishable elementa, it 11 liable to fly
asunder and perish 3 as animated and therefore capable of feeling, it is Ἴ

liable 1ο sensatione of pain and susceptible 01 death (ἓξ 29-34). Ι1
ie partly met by the 81010 doctrine 01 the cyolio renovation, partly by

denying that the capacity 01 pleasure involves the possibility of pain ’

and that this latter involves the possibility 01 death. In ᾖ 35-37 1
Ootta has no difficulty in showing that fire is not more divine than
the other elementa.

After this follows an interesting argument on the competibility
011110 ideas of virtue aud divinity (ἓ 38). Αο we may 100 by com-
paring Sextus, this has been very much cut down by Oiccro. The
quotations in the notes will show with what limitatione it holds good
The subordinate deities 01 the 810101 are subjected to aserere c1iticism
in ἓξ 39-64. Ι1 11 shown that Stoic allegorization is purely arbitrary,
that it 11 impossible to draw the line between the human and divine
