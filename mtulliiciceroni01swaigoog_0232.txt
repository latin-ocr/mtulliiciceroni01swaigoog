peragetur, Marquardthm. St. 111391. If in the precatio mxima all the
gods were cited, we may suppose that even the smaller springs and rivers
would be included.

Tiberinum: according 1ο Varro L. L. v 71 Tiberinus was the ,title of
the deity as distinguished from the river.

Almonem: a correction for the 111 anemonen.. The Almo was a small
stream running into the Tiber just below the walls of Rome: the grotto
which was built over its source is still in existence, containing the muti·
lated image of the deity of the stream. The Almo is chiefly known in
connexion with the worship of Cybele, whose image brought from Pessinus
was lauded at its junction with the Tiber in no. 204, and was regularly
washed there once a year, see Dict. of Geop. s v.

Spinonem, Nodinum: these streame are not mentioned elsewhere:
no doubt they were in the immediate neighbourhood of the city, and were
therefore included in the ancient litany of the augure. The more insigui-
ficant they were in themselves, the more appropriate would they be for
the purpose of Ootta's argument.
