NOTES ΟΝ THE FRAGMENTS.

1. Tun first and second fragments are given in Lambinus' edition.
The former might naturally introduce section Ο of Book 111, where Oicero
criticiaes the Stoic argument in proof of the Providential government of
the universe. For the cantion to be observed in theologioal discussion cf.

2. This fragmentis interesting as bringing distinctly forward the
question whether (lod is a Creator, in the strict sense of the term, or
merely a Builder and Architect, employingpreexisting matter to hamc the
world which we see. Compare on this subject Mosheim’s dissertation con-
tained in Cudworth vol ³ p. 140 foll. He maintains that even the Neo-
Platonista never conceived oi matter in itself as an actual creatiom but
rather aa a coeternal shadow or emanation of Deity. cf. Theodoret
Gracc. Aff. p. 63 h 44 ξυνυπάρχειν τῷ θεῷ τὴν ὕληνκαὶ οὗτος (Plato) ἔφησε,

mentation of this passage would suggest that it was a moot point whether
pure matter, the ἄποιος ὕλη itself, was not made by the Creator, as well as
the world which pmceeded ont ol it. The Stolos, while maintaining the
eternity of matter, identified (lod with a particular form of matter, the
Artistic Fire, into which all other forms of matter were merged in the
cyclic conflagration, and out of which the Oosmos was periodically evolved
This forms the subject oi section Co in Book 11, cf. 11 inprovidens

as amisionem, but as suffer (11 57). We may understand therefore

that, while the Stoice would shrink from speaking of the ereation of
matter, since (lod himself was material, they would have no objection to

speak of tha different elements as created. Cotta is here endeavouring
to show the inconsistency of the two beliefs by means of his favorite
amites. ‘Yon agree that the Divine Architect‚ lilre the human archi-
